The energy of the $\\pi$ electrons is given by the following equation:\n\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{n}}=\\frac{n^{2} h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}}\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the quantum number $(n=1,2,3, \\ldots), h$ is Planck's constant, $m$ is the mass of electron, and $L$ is the length of the box which may be approximated by $L=(k+2) \\times 1.40 \\AA$ ( $k$ being the number of conjugated double bonds along the carbon chain in the molecule). A photon with the appropriate wavelength $\\lambda$ may promote $a$ m electron from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). An approximate semi-empirical formula based on this model which relates the wavelength $\\lambda$, to the number of double bonds $k$ and constant $B$ is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\lambda(\\mathrm{nm})=B \\times \\frac{(k+2)^{2}}{(2 k+1)}\n$$Using this semi-empirical formula with $B=65.01 \\mathrm{~nm}$ calculate the value of the wavelength $\\lambda(\\mathrm{nm})$ for octatetraene $\\left(\\mathrm{CH}_{2}=\\mathrm{CH}-\\mathrm{CH}=\\mathrm{CH}-\\mathrm{CH}=\\mathrm{CH}-\\mathrm{CH}=\\mathrm{CH}_{2}\\right)$.",

The minimum concentration of chloride ions needed in oyster beds for normal growth is $8 \\mathrm{ppm}\\left(8 \\mathrm{mg} \\mathrm{dm}^{-3}\\right)$.\n\nAfter one week of heavy rain, the following analysis is done on water from the bay. To a $50.00 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ sample of bay water a few drops of a $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{CrO}_{4}$ solution are added. The sample is then titrated with $16.16 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of a $0.00164 \\mathrm{M} \\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ solution.

In this method an excess of $\\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ is added to the sample. The excess $\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$is titrated with standardized $\\mathrm{KSCN}$, forming a precipitate of $\\mathrm{AgSCN}$.
