Since the problem asks for work of \"the same expansion,\" I interpret this as an expansion where the gas started at a higher pressure (lower volume) and expanded to the given state.\n\nHowever, looking at the problem more carefully, it seems like I need additional information about the initial state. Let me reconsider: perhaps this is asking about the work done if the gas expanded from some standard state.\n\nActually, re-reading the problem, I think it's asking about a reversible expansion where we know the final state (4.50 g, 12.7 dm³, 310 K), and we need to calculate the work done during this expansion. But without knowing the initial volume, I cannot calculate the expansion work directly.\n\nLet me assume this is an isothermal expansion from an initial volume V₁ to the final volume V₂ = 12.7 dm³. For a reversible isothermal expansion of a perfect gas:\n\nW = -nRT ln(V₂/V₁)\n\nBut I still need V₁. Let me check if there's another interpretation...\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is asking about the work done during an isothermal reversible expansion where the gas goes from some initial pressure P₁ to the final pressure P₂, and I calculated P₂ = 56.89 kPa above.\n\nLooking at this problem again, I think there might be missing information about the initial state. However, if I assume this is an expansion from standard conditions (1 bar, 298.15 K) to the final state, I need to account for both temperature and pressure changes.\n\nLet me try a different approach. If this is asking about work done in bringing the gas to the final state reversibly, and if I assume the initial state is at standard conditions:\n\nInitial state: P₁ = 1 bar = 100,000 Pa, T₁ = 298.15 K\nFinal state: P₂ = 56,890 Pa, T₂ = 310 K\n\nFor this process, if I assume it occurs in two steps:\n1. Isothermal expansion at T₁ from P₁ to some intermediate pressure\n2. Isobaric heating to final temperature\n\nBut this is getting complex without clear initial conditions.\n\nLet me reconsider: perhaps \"the same expansion\" refers to the expansion needed to achieve the given state from standard conditions. \n\nAt standard conditions (298.15 K, 1 bar):\nV₁ = nRT₁/P₁ = (0.2806)(8.314)(298.15)/(100,000) = 6.95 × 10⁻³ m³ = 6.95 dm³\n\nNow for isothermal expansion at 310 K from this corrected initial volume to final volume:\nFirst, I need the initial volume at 310 K:\nV₁(at 310 K) = V₁(at 298.15 K) × (310/298.15) = 6.95 × (310/298.15) = 7.23 dm³\n\nFor isothermal reversible expansion from 7.23 dm³ to 12.7 dm³:\nW = -nRT ln(V₂/V₁)\nW = -(0.2806)(8.314)(310) ln(12.7/7.23)\nW = -722.6 ln(1.757)\nW = -722.6 × 0.5639\nW = -407.5 J\n\nSince work is done by the system (expansion), it's negative, but the question asks for \"work that would be done,\" so I'll report the magnitude.\n\n\\boxed{407.5} J", "elapsed_time": 23.93}

However, the problem statement seems incomplete as it doesn't specify which reaction we're considering. \n\nLooking at the context, this appears to be asking about a temperature where K = 1 for some reaction involving CO₂. When K = 1, the standard Gibbs free energy change (ΔG°) equals zero.\n\nFrom the relationship between Gibbs free energy and equilibrium constant:\nΔG° = -RT ln K\n\nWhen K = 1:\nΔG° = -RT ln(1) = -RT(0) = 0\n\nThis means at the temperature where K = 1, we have:\nΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS° = 0\n\nTherefore:\nT = ΔH°/ΔS°\n\nHowever, since the problem doesn't provide specific thermodynamic data (ΔH° and ΔS°) for a particular reaction, and doesn't specify which reaction we're analyzing, I cannot determine the exact temperature.\n\nLooking at the given information more carefully, this appears to be part of a larger problem where previous parts would have established the reaction and provided the necessary thermodynamic data. \n\nWithout the specific reaction and thermodynamic data, I cannot solve this problem. The problem statement appears to be incomplete or missing crucial information from earlier parts.\n\nSince I cannot determine the answer with the given information, I cannot provide a numerical result.

{"index": 296, "question": "When the fresh-water rivers that run into the Chesapeake Bay flood after heavy rains in the spring, the increase in fresh water in the Bay causes a decrease in the salinity in the areas where oysters grow. The minimum concentration of chloride ions needed in oyster beds for normal growth is $8 \\mathrm{ppm}\\left(8 \\mathrm{mg} \\mathrm{dm}^{-3}\\right)$.\n\nAfter one week of heavy rain, the following analysis is done on water from the bay. To a $50.00 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ sample of bay water a few drops of a $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{CrO}_{4}$ solution are added. The sample is then titrated with $16.16 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of a $0.00164 \\mathrm{M} \\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ solution. After $\\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ solution has been added to the sample a bright red-orange precipitate forms.\n\nThe chloride concentration in another $50.00 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ sample of bay water was determined by the Volhard method. In this method an excess of $\\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ is added to the sample. The excess $\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$is titrated with standardized $\\mathrm{KSCN}$, forming a precipitate of $\\mathrm{AgSCN}$.
