The OCOH dihedral angle of 0° corresponds to the syn conformer, where the carbonyl oxygen and the hydroxyl hydrogen are on the same side (eclipsed in the planar structure). This is the more stable conformer.\n\n2. **Computational Method**: Perform geometry optimization using Hartree-Fock (HF) method with the 6-31G* basis set. The initial geometry is set with the OCOH dihedral fixed at 0°, but during optimization, the structure relaxes to the minimum energy configuration, which maintains planarity and the syn arrangement.\n\n3. **Optimization Details**: The optimization converges to a planar geometry with typical bond lengths (e.g., C=O ≈ 1.185 Å, C-O ≈ 1.323 Å, O-H ≈ 0.956 Å, C-H ≈ 1.085 Å) and angles (e.g., O=C-O ≈ 123.5°).
