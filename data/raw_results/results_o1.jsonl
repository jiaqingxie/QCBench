Each equilibrium produces some amount of the conjugate acid:\n\n• Let y₁ = [HA] formed from A⁻  \n• Let y₂ = [HB] formed from B⁻  \n\nThen the equilibrium concentrations are:  \n[A⁻] = 0.06 − y₁,   [HA] = y₁  \n[B⁻] = 0.04 − y₂,   [HB] = y₂  \n\nFrom the definition of Kb for each reaction:\n\nKb(A⁻) = [HA][OH⁻] / [A⁻] = 5.75×10⁻⁸,  \nKb(B⁻) = [HB][OH⁻] / [B⁻] = 7.46×10⁻⁸.  \n\nBecause every mole of HA formed creates one mole of OH⁻, we have y₁ = amount of OH⁻ from (1), and similarly y₂ = amount of OH⁻ from (2).  Hence, the total [OH⁻] is\n\nx = y₁ + y₂.\n\nA convenient way to solve the system (assuming x is sufficiently larger than Kb) is to note that, in each equilibrium expression, the denominator x + Kb ≈ x if x ≫ Kb.  Then,\n\ny₁ ≈ ( Kb(A⁻) × 0.06 ) / x,   \ny₂ ≈ ( Kb(B⁻) × 0.04 ) / x,   \nx = y₁ + y₂.\n\nPutting in the numerical values:\n\n• Kb(A⁻) × 0.06 = (5.75×10⁻⁸)(0.06) = 3.45×10⁻⁹,  \n• Kb(B⁻) × 0.04 = (7.46×10⁻⁸)(0.04) = 2.984×10⁻⁹.  \n\nHence,\n\nx = y₁ + y₂ ≈ (3.45×10⁻⁹ / x) + (2.984×10⁻⁹ / x) = (3.45×10⁻⁹ + 2.984×10⁻⁹) / x = 6.434×10⁻⁹ / x.\n\nThis implies\n\nx² = 6.434×10⁻⁹   \n⟹   x = √(6.434×10⁻⁹) = 8.03×10⁻⁵ mol dm⁻³.\n\nThus,\n\npOH = −log(x) = −log(8.03×10⁻⁵) ≈ 4.10,  \npH = 14.00 − 4.10 = 9.90.\n\nHence, the final pH of solution Y is approximately 9.90.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9.90}\n\\]", "elapsed_time": 87.26}

Since the bond angle is 117°, each O–O bond makes an angle of 58.5° with the bisector.\n\n2) Let the O–O bond length be r = 128 pm = 1.28 × 10⁻¹⁰ m, and let each oxygen’s mass be m = 16 u = 16 × 1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg.\n\n3) In this setup:  \n   • O₂ is at (0, 0).  \n   • O₁ is at (r cos 58.5°, r sin 58.5°).  \n   • O₃ is at (r cos 58.5°, −r sin 58.5°).\n\n4) The center of mass (CM) coordinates (x_CM, y_CM) are found via  \n   x_CM = (1/(3m)) [m·0 + m·r cos 58.5° + m·r cos 58.5°]  \n        = (2/3) r cos 58.5°,  \n   y_CM = 0  \n   so the CM lies on the x-axis.\n\n5) Shift the origin to the CM.  Denoting the new coordinates by (x′, y′), one obtains:  \n   • O₂:  (x₂′, y₂′) = (−(2/3)r cos 58.5°, 0).  \n   • O₁:  (x₁′, y₁′) = (r cos 58.5° − (2/3)r cos 58.5°, r sin 58.5°)  \n                     = ((1/3)r cos 58.5°, r sin 58.5°).  \n   • O₃:  (x₃′, y₃′) = ((1/3)r cos 58.5°, −r sin 58.5°).\n\n6) To find the moment of inertia I about the bisector (the x′-axis through the CM), recall that the distance of each mass from that axis is simply its |y′| coordinate (since the molecule is planar and z′ = 0). Thus,  \n   I = ∑ m (distance)² = m y₂′² + m y₁′² + m y₃′².\n\n   Because y₂′ = 0 for the central oxygen, only O₁ and O₃ contribute:\n   y₁′ = r sin 58.5° and y₃′ = −r sin 58.5°,  \n   so  \n   I = m [(r sin 58.5°)² + (−r sin 58.5°)² ]  \n     = 2m r² sin²(58.5°).\n\n7) Numerically,  \n   • m = 16 × 1.6605 × 10⁻²⁷ kg ≈ 2.657 × 10⁻²⁶ kg,  \n   • r = 1.28 × 10⁻¹⁰ m,  so  r² = 1.6384 × 10⁻²⁰ m²,  \n   • sin(58.5°) ≈ 0.8526, hence sin²(58.5°) ≈ 0.727.\n\n   Therefore,\n   I = 2 × (2.657 × 10⁻²⁶ kg) × (1.6384 × 10⁻²⁰ m²) × 0.727  \n     ≈ 6.3 × 10⁻⁴⁶ kg m².\n\nAnswer (with unit after the box):\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6.3\\times 10^{-46}}\n\\]\nkg m².", "elapsed_time": 133.5}
