A 20.00 cm¬≥ portion of this stock solution required 19.40 cm¬≥ of 0.100 mol dm‚Åª¬?NaOH for neutralization.\n\nFirst, calculate the moles of NaOH used in the titration:\n- Volume of NaOH = 19.40 cm¬≥ = 19.40 / 1000 = 0.01940 dm¬≥\n- Concentration of NaOH = 0.100 mol dm‚Åª¬≥\n- Moles of NaOH = concentration √ó volume = 0.100 mol dm‚Åª¬?√ó 0.01940 dm¬≥ = 0.001940 mol\n\nAssuming a monoprotic acid, the moles of acid in the 20.00 cm¬≥ portion of the stock solution equal the moles of NaOH used, which is 0.001940 mol.\n\nThe total volume of the stock solution is 100 cm¬≥. The moles of acid in the entire stock solution are found using the ratio of volumes:\n- Moles of acid in total stock solution = (moles in 20.00 cm¬≥) √ó (total volume / portion volume) = 0.001940 mol √ó (100 cm¬≥ / 20.00 cm¬≥) = 0.001940 mol √ó 5.000 = 0.009700 mol\n\nConsidering significant figures, the concentration of NaOH (0.100 mol dm‚Åª¬? has three significant figures, limiting the moles of NaOH to three significant figures (0.00194 mol). The volume ratio (100 / 20.00) is exact (5.000). Thus, the total moles of acid are 0.00970 mol.\n\nThe sample mass (1.044 g) is not required, as the question asks for the amount of acid in moles.\n\n\\boxed{0.00970} mol", "elapsed_time": 110.44}
