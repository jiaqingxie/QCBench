The given data includes the enthalpy of vaporization, which is 29.4 kJ/mol, and the boiling temperature, 334.88 K. Hmm, right. \n\nWait, entropy change during vaporization... I remember that at the boiling point, the process is at equilibrium between liquid and vapor. So, the Gibbs free energy change should be zero. That means ΔG = ΔH - TΔS = 0. Therefore, rearranging that, ΔS should be equal to ΔH divided by T. Yeah, that sounds right. So the entropy of vaporization ΔS_vap = ΔH_vap / T_b.\n\nBut wait, units. The enthalpy is given in kJ per mole, and the temperature is in Kelvin. The answer needs to be in J/(K·mol). So I need to convert kJ to J. Let me check. 29.4 kJ is 29,400 J. Then divide that by 334.88 K. \n\nLet me write that out:\n\nΔS_vap = (29.4 kJ/mol) / 334.88 K. But convert kJ to J: 29.4 * 1000 = 29400 J/mol.\n\nSo 29400 J/mol divided by 334.88 K. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 29400 divided by 334.88. Let me do this division. Let me get a calculator. Hmm, 29400 ÷ 334.88 ≈ ?\n\nLet me approximate. 334.88 times 80 is 334.88*80 = 26,790.4. Hmm, 334.88*87 = 334.88*(80+7) = 26,790.4 + 2,344.16 = 29,134.56. That's close to 29,400. The difference is 29,400 - 29,134.56 = 265.44. Then 265.44 / 334.88 ≈ 0.79. So total is approximately 87.79 J/(K·mol). \n\nWait, but let me check with a calculator. 29400 divided by 334.88. Let's see:\n\n334.88 goes into 29400 how many times?\n\nMultiply 334.88 by 80: 334.88 * 80 = 26,790.4\n\nSubtract that from 29,400: 29,400 - 26,790.4 = 2,609.6\n\nNow, 334.88 * 7 = 2,344.16\n\nSubtract that from 2,609.6: 2,609.6 - 2,344.16 = 265.44\n\nSo now, 265.44 / 334.88 ≈ 0.792\n\nSo total is 80 + 7 + 0.792 ≈ 87.792. So approximately 87.8 J/(K·mol). \n\nBut wait, the question says to present the answer in J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹. So the value is approximately 87.8. Let me check if my calculation is precise. Alternatively, maybe I should use more exact numbers.\n\nAlternatively, use exact computation:\n\n29400 / 334.88 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29400 ÷ 334.88.\n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 4: 7350 / 83.72 ≈ ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, use decimal division.\n\n334.88 × 87 = 29,134.56 (as before)\n\n29,400.00 - 29,134.56 = 265.44\n\nSo 265.44 / 334.88 = 0.792 approximately.\n\nSo total is 87.792, which rounds to 87.8. But wait, the original data: the enthalpy is 29.4 kJ/mol. That's three significant figures. The temperature is 334.88 K, which is five significant figures. So the least number of significant figures is three (from 29.4). Therefore, the answer should be three significant figures. 87.79 rounds to 87.8. So 87.8 J/(K·mol). \n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the exact calculation with a calculator. Let me take out my calculator.\n\n29400 divided by 334.88. Let's compute:\n\n334.88 × 87 = 29,134.56\n\n29,400 - 29,134.56 = 265.44\n\n265.44 ÷ 334.88 = 0.7926 approximately.\n\nSo total is 87.7926, which rounds to 87.8 when keeping three significant figures. So yes, 87.8 J/(K·mol). \n\nBut wait, wait. Let me check with precise calculation:\n\nCompute 29400 / 334.88:\n\nLet me write this as 29400 / 334.88 = ?\n\nLet me convert both numbers to decimals:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100: 294 / 3.3488 = ?\n\nNow, 3.3488 × 87 = 3.3488*80=267.904; 3.3488*7=23.4416; total 267.904+23.4416=291.3456\n\nBut 294 / 3.3488 = ?\n\nWait, 3.3488 × 87.8 = ?\n\n3.3488 × 80 = 267.904\n\n3.3488 × 7 = 23.4416\n\n3.3488 × 0.8 = 2.67904\n\nAdding up: 267.904 + 23.4416 = 291.3456 + 2.67904 = 294.02464\n\nWait, so 3.3488 × 87.8 ≈ 294.02464, which is very close to 294. So 294 / 3.3488 ≈ 87.8. Exactly! So the result is 87.8. Therefore, the entropy of vaporization is 87.8 J/(K·mol). \n\nSo the formula used is ΔS_vap = ΔH_vap / T_b. That's the standard formula for entropy change at phase transition (since at equilibrium, ΔG=0). \n\nTherefore, the answer should be \\boxed{87.8} J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹. But wait, wait. Let me check the exact value again. If 3.3488 × 87.8 = 294.02464, then 294.02464 / 3.3488 = 87.8. But our numerator is 294.0 (since 29400 / 100 = 294), so this suggests that the exact value is 87.8. Therefore, the calculation is correct. \n\nBut wait, the enthalpy of vaporization is given as 29.4 kJ/mol. So three significant figures. So 29.4 kJ/mol is 29400 J/mol. So three sig figs. The temperature is 334.88 K, which is five sig figs. So the limiting factor is three sig figs. So 87.8 is three sig figs. Correct. \n\nTherefore, the entropy of vaporization is 87.8 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹. \n\nI think that's all. Let me recap. The key idea is that at the boiling point, vaporization is at equilibrium, so ΔG=0, leading to ΔS = ΔH / T. Then unit conversion and division. Yep, that's the process.\n<\n</think>\n\nTo calculate the **entropy of vaporization** of chloroform at its normal boiling point, we use the thermodynamic relationship that applies at phase equilibrium:\n\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\text{vap}} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}}{T_b}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}}$ is the **enthalpy of vaporization**,\n- $T_b$ is the **boiling temperature** in Kelvin.\n\n---\n\n### **Step 1: Convert Units**\n\nWe are given:\n- $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap}} = 29.4\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}} = 29400\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}$\n- $T_b = 334.88\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 2: Apply the Formula**\n\n$$\n\\Delta S_{\\text{vap}} = \\frac{29400\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}}{334.88\\ \\mathrm{K}} \\approx 87.8\\ \\mathrm{J\\ K^{-1}\\ mol^{-1}}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### **Step 3: Consider Significant Figures**\n\nThe enthalpy of vaporization is given to **three significant figures**, and the temperature is given to **five significant figures**.

Calculate the compression factor under these conditions.", "gt_answer": "0.88", "unit": "", "reference": "atkins", "source": "SciBench", "class": "Physical", "llm_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the compression factor (also called the compressibility factor) for a gas at 250 K and 15 atm. The problem states that the molar volume is 12% smaller than that calculated from the perfect gas law. Hmm, let me recall what the compression factor is. \n\nFrom what I remember, the compression factor Z is defined as the ratio of the actual molar volume of a gas to the molar volume predicted by the ideal gas law at the same temperature and pressure. The formula is Z = V_m / V_m^ideal, where V_m is the real molar volume and V_m^ideal is the ideal one. If Z is less than 1, it means the gas is more compressible than an ideal gas, which usually happens when attractive forces dominate. If Z is more than 1, repulsive forces dominate.\n\nIn this problem, the molar volume is 12% smaller than the ideal one. So that means V_m = V_m^ideal - 0.12 * V_m^ideal = 0.88 * V_m^ideal. Therefore, the compression factor Z should be 0.88? Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. If the real volume is smaller than the ideal, then Z = V_real / V_ideal = 0.88. So yes, Z would be 0.88. But maybe I need to check the definition again. \n\nWait, actually, the compression factor is defined as Z = PV/(RT), where V is the molar volume. Alternatively, since the ideal gas law is PV = RT for one mole, so V_ideal = RT/P. Then the real volume V_real = Z * V_ideal. Wait, no: Let's clarify.\n\nThe compressibility factor Z is defined as Z = PV/(RT), where P is pressure, V is the molar volume, T is temperature, and R is the gas constant. For an ideal gas, PV = RT, so Z = 1. If Z < 1, the gas is more compressible (volume less than ideal), and if Z > 1, less compressible.\n\nAlternatively, rearranging Z = PV/(RT), we can write V = Z*(RT/P). Therefore, V_real = Z * V_ideal. Which would mean that Z = V_real / V_ideal. Because V_ideal = RT/P. So yes, if the real volume is 0.88 times the ideal volume, then Z = 0.88. So that seems straightforward.\n\nBut let me make sure. Let's go step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the molar volume expected from the perfect gas law. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT. For molar volume, n = 1 mole, so V_ideal = RT/P.\n\nBut in the problem, the actual molar volume is 12% smaller. So V_real = V_ideal - 0.12*V_ideal = 0.88*V_ideal.\n\nThen, the compressibility factor Z = V_real / V_ideal = 0.88. But wait, according to the definition Z = PV/(RT). Let's check this.\n\nIf V_real = 0.88 V_ideal, then substituting V_ideal = RT/P into V_real gives V_real = 0.88*(RT/P). Then Z = P V_real / (RT) = P*(0.88 RT / P) / (RT) = 0.88. So yes, same result. Therefore, Z = 0.88.\n\nWait, so is that the answer? 0.88? But the problem gives temperature and pressure. Wait, but according to this reasoning, the Z is just the ratio of the volumes, so regardless of temperature and pressure, if the real volume is 12% smaller than ideal, then Z is 0.88. Hmm. But is there a chance that the problem is trying to trick me here?\n\nWait, but the compression factor is a function of temperature and pressure, so in this case, given that the molar volume is 12% smaller than ideal, then regardless of the pressure and temperature, Z would be 0.88. But maybe the problem is testing the definition of Z here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting me to compute Z using the given temperature and pressure, but since we know the volume deviation, we can just get Z directly. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have Z = PV_m / RT. Here, V_m is the real molar volume. If the real V_m is 12% smaller than V_m_ideal, then V_m = 0.88 V_m_ideal. Since V_m_ideal = RT/P, substituting that into V_m gives V_m = 0.88*(RT/P). Then plug into Z:\n\nZ = P*(0.88 RT / P) / RT = 0.88. Yep, same result. So regardless of the pressure and temperature, if the volume is 12% smaller than ideal, then Z is 0.88. Therefore, the answer is 0.88.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives temperature and pressure. Maybe they are distractors? Or maybe in some other approach? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had given different data, such as the volume and asked for something else, but here, since the question is asking for the compression factor, which is directly related to the ratio of volumes. Since Z = V_real / V_ideal, then if the real volume is 12% smaller, then Z = 0.88.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that 12% smaller than the ideal volume means that V_ideal - V_real = 0.12 V_ideal, which would give V_real = 0.88 V_ideal. Which is the same as above.\n\nTherefore, unless there's a different interpretation, the compression factor Z should be 0.88.\n\nWait, but let me check units. The problem says \"molar volume 12 per cent smaller\". So, the actual volume is 12% less than the ideal. So yes, Z = 0.88.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said that the volume is 12% of the ideal volume, then it would be different. But \"12% smaller\" means subtract 12% of the original. So 100% - 12% = 88%, so 0.88 times the ideal volume.\n\nTherefore, unless there's a trick here, the answer should be 0.88.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with the given pressure and temperature. Let's see. Let's compute V_ideal and then V_real.\n\nGiven T = 250 K, P = 15 atm.\n\nFirst, compute V_ideal = RT/P.\n\nBut R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), right? So:\n\nV_ideal = (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)) * 250 K / 15 atm.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.0821 * 250 = 20.525 L·atm/mol / 15 atm = 20.525 / 15 = approx 1.368 L/mol.\n\nSo V_ideal ≈ 1.368 L/mol.\n\nThen V_real is 12% smaller, so:\n\nV_real = 1.368 * (1 - 0.12) = 1.368 * 0.88 = approx 1.204 L/mol.\n\nNow compute Z = PV_real / RT.\n\nCompute numerator: P*V_real = 15 atm * 1.204 L/mol = 18.06 L·atm/mol.\n\nDenominator: RT = 0.0821 * 250 = 20.525 L·atm/mol.\n\nWait, so Z = 18.06 / 20.525 ≈ 0.88.\n\nSame result. So even when calculating numerically, we get 0.88. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the compression factor Z is 0.88.\n\nBut wait, in the calculation above, when I compute V_ideal = RT/P:\n\nR = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), T = 250 K, P = 15 atm.\n\nV_ideal = (0.0821 * 250) / 15 = 20.525 / 15 = 1.3683 L/mol.\n\nThen V_real = 0.88 * 1.3683 = 1.204 L/mol.\n\nThen Z = (P V_real) / (R T) = (15 * 1.204) / (0.0821 * 250) = (18.06) / (20.525) ≈ 0.88.\n\nExactly. So regardless of the pressure and temperature, Z is 0.88. The given temperature and pressure are just there to maybe make us think we need to use them, but in reality, since the ratio of volumes is given, Z is just that ratio.\n\nBut in case, if the problem had said that the volume is 12% smaller than the ideal, then Z = 0.88. So the answer is 0.88.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"molar volume 12 per cent smaller than that calculated from the perfect gas law\". So that ratio is exactly what Z is. Therefore, Z = 0.88.\n\nI think that's the answer. So the compression factor is 0.88.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe compression factor is \\boxed{0.88}.\n<\n</think>\n\nTo determine the **compression factor** $ Z $ of a gas, we begin by recalling its definition:\n\n$$\nZ = \\frac{V_m}{V_m^{\\text{ideal}}}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ V_m $ is the **actual molar volume** of the gas,\n- $ V_m^{\\text{ideal}} $ is the **molar volume predicted by the ideal gas law** at the same temperature and pressure.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Given Information\n\nWe are told that the **molar volume is 12% smaller** than the ideal molar volume.

The problem says that when the gas undergoes adiabatic expansion from 32 atm to 1.00 atm, the temperature drops by 22 K. The initial temperature is 0°C, which is 273.15 K. The temperature change is negative because it's a fall, so ΔT = -22 K. The pressure change ΔP would be final pressure minus initial pressure, so 1.00 atm - 32 atm = -31 atm. \n\nWait, the Joule-Thomson coefficient μ is defined as the change in temperature divided by the change in pressure at constant enthalpy. The formula is μ = (ΔT / ΔP)_H. But since the process is adiabatic, which is a constant enthalpy process for a throttling process, right? So that should apply here.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the temperature fell by 22 K. So ΔT is -22 K, and ΔP is -31 atm. Then μ would be (-22 K) / (-31 atm) = 22/31 K/atm. Let me compute that. 22 divided by 31 is approximately 0.7097. So approximately 0.71 K atm⁻¹. Hmm, but wait, the question says to assume that μ remains constant over this temperature range. So even though the temperature changes, we can approximate μ as constant. \n\nWait, but is there a different approach? Let me recall. The Joule-Thomson coefficient is given by μ = (∂T/∂P)_H. For a throttling process, which is an isenthalpic expansion, the coefficient relates the temperature change to the pressure change. For a perfect gas, the Joule-Thomson coefficient is zero, but here the gas is not perfect because it's a freon, which might have significant intermolecular forces. However, the problem says to assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Wait, but in this case, the temperature is changing, so if it were a perfect gas, the Joule-Thomson coefficient would be zero, which would mean no temperature change. But here there is a temperature change, so the gas must be non-ideal. However, the problem says \"Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise.\" Wait, but the problem didn't state that the gas is non-perfect. Hmm, this seems contradictory. Wait, but the problem says \"when a certain freon used in refrigeration was expanded adiabatically\" – freons are known to have non-negligible intermolecular interactions, so maybe we can't assume it's perfect. However, the first line says \"Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise.\" Wait, but the problem didn't state that the freon is a perfect gas. Hmm, this might be a trick. Wait, but the problem says \"unless stated otherwise\", so if the problem doesn't state that it's perfect, then we can't assume it's perfect. Wait, but the first line says \"Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise.\" So unless stated otherwise, we should assume they are perfect. But in that case, the Joule-Thomson coefficient would be zero, which contradicts the observed temperature change. Therefore, there must be something wrong here. Wait, but the problem is asking to calculate μ, so we can't assume it's zero. Therefore, perhaps the initial statement \"Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise\" is not applicable here? Or maybe the problem is using the perfect gas approximation but still wants us to compute μ? Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, but the problem says \"Calculate the Joule-Thomson coefficient, μ, at 0°C, assuming it remains constant over this temperature range.\" So regardless of the gas being perfect or not, we can just compute μ as ΔT / ΔP. So maybe the first line is not applicable here? Or maybe the problem is designed such that even though the gas is perfect, but we have a temperature change, which would imply that μ is zero, but that's impossible. Wait, no. For a perfect gas, the Joule-Thomson coefficient is zero. Therefore, the temperature should not change during a throttling process. But in reality, freon has a non-zero μ, so the problem is assuming that the gas is non-perfect. However, the first line says \"Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise.\" Hmm, but the problem didn't state that this gas is non-perfect. So this is conflicting. Wait, but the problem gives us a temperature change, so regardless of the initial assumption, we have to calculate μ. Therefore, maybe the first line is just a general instruction, but in this problem, since we are given data that implies non-perfect behavior, we can ignore the first line? Or perhaps the problem is designed to use the perfect gas law in some way? Hmm. Wait, but the Joule-Thomson coefficient for a perfect gas is zero. But here we have a non-zero μ. Therefore, the problem must be assuming that the gas is non-perfect, despite the first line. Maybe the first line is just a default, but when you have a problem where μ is non-zero, you have to ignore that. So perhaps proceed with the calculation. \n\nSo, going back. The Joule-Thomson coefficient is μ = ΔT / ΔP. The temperature change is -22 K, pressure change is -31 atm. So μ = (-22 K)/(-31 atm) = 22/31 K/atm. Let me compute that. 22 divided by 31 is approximately 0.709677. So approximately 0.71 K atm⁻¹. But maybe we need to be more precise. 22 divided by 31: 31 × 0.7 = 21.7, so 0.7 + (0.3 / 31) ≈ 0.7 + 0.009677 = 0.7097. So approximately 0.710. But the problem says \"assuming it remains constant over this temperature range,\" so we can just take the ratio. So the answer is 22 divided by 31, positive, so 0.71 K atm⁻¹. But wait, units are K atm⁻¹, so written as K/atm. So 22 divided by 31 is approximately 0.71. But let me check if there's a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, if the process is Joule-Thomson expansion, then the relation between ΔT and ΔP is given by ΔT = μ ΔP. But wait, no. Actually, μ = (∂T/∂P)_H, so integrating from initial to final states assuming μ is constant:\n\n∫ dT = μ ∫ dP (at constant H)\n\nSo T_final - T_initial = μ (P_final - P_initial)\n\nSo ΔT = μ ΔP\n\nTherefore, μ = ΔT / ΔP\n\nSo ΔT = -22 K, ΔP = 1.00 atm - 32 atm = -31 atm\n\nSo μ = (-22 K) / (-31 atm) = 22/31 K/atm ≈ 0.7097 K/atm\n\nRounded to two significant figures, since the temperature change is 22 K (two sig figs), pressure change is 31 atm (two sig figs). Wait, initial pressure is 32 atm (two sig figs), final pressure 1.00 atm (three sig figs). The temperature change is 22 K (two sig figs). So the answer should be two sig figs. 22/31 = 0.7097 ≈ 0.71. So 0.71 K atm⁻¹. So boxed as \\boxed{0.71} K atm⁻¹. \n\nWait, but wait, the initial temperature is 0°C, which is 273.15 K, but the temperature change is 22 K, so that's exact? No, the temperature fall is by 22 K, so that's a difference. So 22 K has two sig figs. The pressure change is from 32 atm (two sig figs) to 1.00 atm (three sig figs), so ΔP is -31 atm, which is two sig figs. Hmm, so the least sig figs is two, so the answer should have two sig figs. So 0.71 is two sig figs. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.71 K atm⁻¹. So boxed 0.71 and then the unit. \n\nWait, but let me check again. The formula ΔT = μ ΔP. So rearranged μ = ΔT / ΔP. The problem says the temperature fell by 22 K, so ΔT = T_final - T_initial = -22 K. ΔP = P_final - P_initial = 1.00 atm - 32 atm = -31 atm. So μ = (-22)/(-31) = positive 22/31. So yes, 0.71. \n\nI think that's all.

Calculate the change in entropy when $25 \\mathrm{~kJ}$ of energy is transferred reversibly and isothermally as heat to a large block of iron at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.", "gt_answer": "67", "unit": "$\\mathrm{J} \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ ", "reference": "atkins", "source": "SciBench", "class": "Physical", "llm_answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to calculate the change in entropy when 25 kJ of energy is transferred reversibly and isothermally as heat to a large block of iron at 100°C. The answer should be in J K⁻¹. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, entropy change. I remember that entropy change (ΔS) for a process is generally given by the heat transferred reversibly divided by the temperature, right? So the formula should be ΔS = q_rev / T. But wait, this is when the process is reversible and isothermal. Since the problem states that the heat transfer is both reversible and isothermal, this formula should apply directly.\n\nBut wait, what's the temperature here? The problem says 100°C. I need to convert that to Kelvin because entropy calculations require absolute temperature. To convert Celsius to Kelvin, I add 273.15. So 100°C + 273.15 = 373.15 K. Got that.\n\nThe heat transferred is 25 kJ. But entropy is in J K⁻¹, so I should convert kJ to J. 25 kJ is 25,000 J. That makes sense.\n\nNow, plugging into the formula: ΔS = q_rev / T. Here, q_rev is 25,000 J and T is 373.15 K. So ΔS = 25000 / 373.15. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, approximate division. Let's see, 25000 divided by 373.15. Let me use a calculator here. 25000 ÷ 373.15 ≈ 67.0 J K⁻¹. Wait, is that right? Let me check.\n\nWait, 373.15 times 60 is 22,389. 373.15 times 67 is 373.15*60=22,389, 373.15*7=2,612.05, so total 22,389 + 2,612.05 = 25,001.05. Oh, wow. So 373.15 multiplied by 67 is approximately 25,001 J. So 25,000 divided by 373.15 ≈ 67.0. But since 373.15 × 67 = 25,001.05, so 25,000 would be slightly less than 67. So maybe 67.0 minus a tiny bit. But since the question gives 25 kJ, which is 25,000 J, and the temperature is 373.15 K, the exact calculation would be 25000 / 373.15.\n\nLet me compute this more accurately. Let's do 25000 ÷ 373.15.\n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 5: 5000 / 74.63. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, use decimal division.\n\n373.15 × 67 = 25,001.05 as above. So 25,000 is 1.05 J less than 373.15 × 67. So subtract 1.05 / 373.15 from 67. Which is negligible. So approximately 67.0 - 0.0028 = 66.9972. So approximately 67.0 J K⁻¹. But wait, since the question says \"a large block of iron\", does that matter? Hmm, a large block would have a nearly constant temperature, so even when heat is added, its temperature doesn't change. So that's why we can use the formula q_rev / T, because it's a reservoir at constant temperature. So that's okay.\n\nWait, but another thought: when heat is transferred into the iron block, is the entropy of the iron block increasing? Yes. But the problem says \"calculate the change in entropy\", but does it specify the system or the total entropy? Wait, the question says \"when 25 kJ of energy is transferred reversibly and isothermally as heat to a large block of iron\". So the entropy change of the iron block. Since the process is reversible and isothermal, then the entropy change of the system (iron block) is q_rev / T. But if the process is reversible, then the total entropy change (universe) is zero. But the question is asking for the entropy change of the block, right? Because the block is the system here.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"calculate the change in entropy\" without specifying, but the heat is transferred to the block. So the entropy of the block increases by q / T. The entropy change of the surroundings would be -q / T if the process is reversible, leading to total entropy change zero. But the question is asking for the entropy change of the block. So yes, it's +25,000 J / 373.15 K ≈ 67.0 J K⁻¹.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the change in entropy\" without qualification. Hmm. Wait, in thermodynamics, when they say \"calculate the entropy change\" for a process, unless specified, it's usually the system. But in this case, the system is the iron block. The heat is being transferred to the block, so the entropy of the block increases. Alternatively, if the heat is leaving the surroundings to go into the block, the entropy of surroundings decreases, but the block's increases. But the question is about the block's entropy change.\n\nBut the problem states \"when 25 kJ of energy is transferred reversibly and isothermally as heat to a large block...\", so the block is receiving heat, so its entropy increases. So the entropy change of the block is q / T. Since the block is at constant temperature (large block, so its temperature doesn't change), so yes, ΔS = 25,000 J / 373.15 K.\n\nSo 25,000 divided by 373.15. Let me compute this with more precision.\n\nLet me use calculator steps:\n\n373.15 × 66 = ?\n\n373.15 × 60 = 22,389\n\n373.15 × 6 = 2,238.9\n\nSo 22,389 + 2,238.9 = 24,627.9\n\nSo 373.15 × 66 = 24,627.9 J\n\nThen 25,000 - 24,627.9 = 372.1 J remaining.\n\nSo 372.1 / 373.15 ≈ 0.997. So total ΔS = 66 + 0.997 ≈ 66.997 J K⁻¹. Approximately 67.0 J K⁻¹.\n\nSo rounding to three significant figures. Wait, the given data: 25 kJ is two significant figures. 100°C is three significant figures (assuming it's exact). Hmm, but 25 kJ is two sig figs. So the answer should be two significant figures. Wait, 25 kJ is written as 25, which is two sig figs. 100°C is three, but converted to 373.15 K, which is five, but if the original data is 100°C (which could be considered as three sig figs), then the temperature is three sig figs. Hmm, but in the problem statement, it's written as 100°C, which is three significant figures. So 25 kJ is two, temperature is three. The rule is that the number of significant figures in the result should be determined by the least precise measurement. However, in entropy calculations, usually, the heat and temperature are considered. But here, the temperature is given as 100°C, which is precise to the nearest degree, so three sig figs. The heat is 25 kJ, two sig figs. So the answer should have two sig figs. Wait, but 25 kJ could be exact? Probably not. The problem says \"25 kJ\", so two sig figs. So the answer should be 67 J K⁻¹, which is two sig figs. Wait, 66.997 rounds to 67.0? Wait, 66.997 rounds to 67.0 if we have three sig figs, but with two sig figs, 67. Hmm.\n\nWait, 25 kJ is two sig figs, so 25,000 J. The temperature is 373.15 K (if we take 100°C as exact, then 273.15 is exact, so 373.15 is five sig figs). Wait, but in the problem statement, it says \"data refer to 298.15 K unless otherwise stated\". Hmm, so the temperature conversion constants are exact? Wait, the problem says \"data refer to 298.15 K unless otherwise stated\". Hmm, not sure. Wait, the temperature here is given as 100°C, so converted to Kelvin is 373.15 K. If the problem says that all data refer to 298.15 K unless stated, but here the temperature is given as 100°C, so we can take that as exact. So the temperature conversion would be exact. So 100°C is exactly 373.15 K. Wait, no. Actually, the Celsius scale is defined such that 0°C is exactly 273.15 K, so 100°C is exactly 373.15 K. So the temperature here is an exact conversion. Therefore, the temperature is exactly 373.15 K. Wait, no. Wait, the Celsius temperature T is defined as T(K) = T(°C) + 273.15. So 100°C is exactly 373.15 K. So the temperature here is an exact value. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says \"data refer to 298.15 K unless otherwise stated\". Hmm, but the temperature here is given as 100°C, so that's the temperature of the iron block. So the temperature of the system is 100°C, which converts exactly to 373.15 K. So the temperature is an exact value here. Then the only uncertainty is in the heat transfer. 25 kJ is given. If it's 25 kJ, written as two significant figures, then the entropy change should be two sig figs.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"25 kJ of energy is transferred\". If this is a precise value, maybe it's an exact number? Probably not. In thermodynamics problems, unless stated, the numbers are treated as with sig figs. So 25 kJ is two sig figs, so the answer should be two sig figs. So 67 J K⁻¹. But wait, 25,000 J / 373.15 K = approximately 66.98 J K⁻¹. Which rounds to 67 J K⁻¹. So the answer is 67 J K⁻¹.\n\nWait, but let me check with a calculator. Let me compute 25000 divided by 373.15.\n\nLet me do this division step by step.\n\nFirst, 373.15 × 60 = 22,389\n\n25,000 - 22,389 = 2,611\n\nSo remaining 2,611 / 373.15 ≈ ?\n\n373.15 × 7 = 2,612.05\n\nSo 2,611 is 2,612.05 - 1.05. So 7 - (1.05 / 373.15) ≈ 7 - 0.0028 = 6.9972.\n\nSo total is 60 + 6.9972 = 66.9972. So approximately 66.997 J K⁻¹. Which rounds to 67.0 J K⁻¹. But considering significant figures, since 25 kJ is two sig figs, we round to 67 J K⁻¹.\n\nBut wait, if the temperature is exact (as per the conversion from Celsius to Kelvin being exact), then the only uncertainty is in the 25 kJ. So 25 kJ is two sig figs, so the answer should have two sig figs. So 67 J K⁻¹.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem states \"25 kJ\" as precise to the nearest kJ, then 25.0 kJ would be three sig figs, but written as 25 kJ, so two. So yes, 67 J K⁻¹.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the heat is \"25 kJ\". If it's written as 25 kJ, then it's two significant figures. So the answer should be two significant figures. So 67 J K⁻¹.\n\nBut in the calculation, it's approximately 66.997, which rounds to 67.0? Wait, no. 66.997 rounded to two significant figures is 67. Rounded to three is 67.0. But two sig figs would be 67. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the entropy change is 67 J K⁻¹.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm the formula again. The entropy change when heat is added reversibly and isothermally is q_rev / T. Yes. And since the block is a large block, its temperature remains constant. So this formula applies. So yes.\n\nAnother check: entropy change units. J / K. Correct. So yes.\n\nSo final answer: 67 J K⁻¹. So boxed, \\boxed{67} J K⁻¹.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. The problem says \"the change in entropy\". If the process is reversible, then the total entropy change (system + surroundings) is zero. But in that case, the entropy change of the system is q / T, and entropy change of surroundings is -q / T. But here, the question is referring to the entropy change of the block (the system). So yes, it should be positive q / T.\n\nAlternatively, if the heat is transferred to the block, then the entropy of the block increases. So yes, positive. So the answer is positive. So 67 J K⁻¹.\n\nI think that's all. Seems straightforward. So the answer is 67 J K⁻¹.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{67} J K^{-1}\n<\n</think>\n\nTo calculate the **change in entropy** when a certain amount of heat is transferred **reversibly and isothermally** to a system, we use the fundamental thermodynamic relation:\n\n$$\n\\Delta S = \\frac{q_{\\text{rev}}}{T}\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $\\Delta S$ is the change in entropy (in $\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$),\n- $q_{\\text{rev}}$ is the **reversible heat transfer** (in $\\mathrm{J}$),\n- $T$ is the **absolute temperature** (in $\\mathrm{K}$).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Convert the temperature to Kelvin\n\nThe temperature is given as $100^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$.

Hmm, right. The question mentions that all gases are perfect, and the data refers to 298.15 K unless stated otherwise. Since the temperature here is 298 K, which is close enough, I guess standard thermodynamic data at that temperature applies.\n\nFirst, I remember that the maximum non-expansion work a system can do is given by the change in Gibbs free energy for the process. Because in a fuel cell, the reaction is happening electrochemically, and the work done by the cell is the electrical work, which is considered non-expansion work. So, the maximum possible work should be equal to the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) of the reaction. That makes sense because under reversible conditions, the Gibbs free energy change is equal to the non-expansion work.\n\nSo, the reaction here is the combustion of methane. Let me write that out. Methane (CH4) reacts with oxygen (O2) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). The balanced equation should be:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nWait, but the state of water here matters. At 298 K, water would be a liquid, right? Because the standard combustion reactions usually take water as liquid unless otherwise specified. But I should confirm that. If the problem doesn't specify, then standard practice is to take H2O as liquid. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, to find ΔG for this reaction, I need to use the standard Gibbs free energies of formation (ΔGf°) of the products and reactants. The formula is:\n\nΔG° = Σ ΔGf°(products) - Σ ΔGf°(reactants)\n\nI need to look up the standard Gibbs free energies of formation for each substance involved. Let me recall or find these values. From standard tables, I think:\n\nΔGf° for CH4(g) is -50.72 kJ/mol (I remember that methane has a negative ΔGf°)\nO2(g) is 0 by definition, since it's an element in its standard state.\nCO2(g) has ΔGf° of -394.36 kJ/mol\nH2O(l) has ΔGf° of -237.18 kJ/mol\n\nWait, let me check these numbers. Different sources might have slightly different values, but they should be around these numbers. For example, the standard Gibbs free energy of formation of CO2(g) is definitely around -394 kJ/mol, and H2O(l) is around -237 kJ/mol. Methane's ΔGf° is about -50.7 kJ/mol. Let me confirm:\n\nYes, according to the CRC Handbook or other thermodynamic tables, the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for:\n\n- CH4(g): -50.72 kJ/mol\n- CO2(g): -394.36 kJ/mol\n- H2O(l): -237.18 kJ/mol\n- O2(g): 0 kJ/mol\n\nPerfect. So now plug these into the equation.\n\nThe reaction is:\n\nCH4(g) + 2 O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2 H2O(l)\n\nCalculating ΔG°:\n\nΔG° = [ΔGf°(CO2) + 2 * ΔGf°(H2O)] - [ΔGf°(CH4) + 2 * ΔGf°(O2)]\n\nSince O2's ΔGf° is zero, the last term is zero.\n\nSo:\n\nΔG° = (-394.36 + 2*(-237.18)) - (-50.72)\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, sum of products:\n\nCO2: -394.36\n\nH2O: 2 * (-237.18) = -474.36\n\nTotal products: -394.36 + (-474.36) = -868.72\n\nReactants:\n\nCH4: -50.72\n\nO2: 0\n\nTotal reactants: -50.72\n\nSo ΔG° = (-868.72) - (-50.72) = -868.72 + 50.72 = -818.00 kJ/mol\n\nWait, so ΔG° is -818.00 kJ per mole of reaction.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the maximum non-expansion work per mole. Since ΔG is negative, that means the reaction is spontaneous, and the magnitude of ΔG is the maximum non-expansion work available. However, the sign here indicates the direction. Since the question is about obtaining work, the maximum non-expansion work that can be obtained should be positive 818 kJ/mol. Because the negative ΔG means the system can do work on the surroundings.\n\nBut wait, in terms of the cell, the work done by the system is -ΔG (if the process is at constant T and P). Wait, I need to be careful with the sign.\n\nThe formula is w_max_non-expansion = ΔG (but with a negative sign if ΔG is negative). Wait, no. Wait, the Gibbs free energy change is equal to the non-expansion work done by the system. So ΔG = w_non-expansion (at constant T and P, reversible conditions). Wait, but actually, the maximum non-expansion work is equal to the negative of the Gibbs free energy change. Wait, I might be confused here.\n\nWait, let me recall. The change in Gibbs energy ΔG equals the maximum non-expansion work that can be done by the system (since expansion work is excluded). Wait, but the sign. If ΔG is negative, then the system can do work on the surroundings. So the maximum non-expansion work is negative ΔG. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the formula is:\n\nw_max_non_expansion = -ΔG (if ΔG is negative, then w_max is positive, work done by the system).\n\nWait, I need to check this. Let me recall:\n\nAt constant temperature and pressure, the maximum non-expansion work that can be done by the system is equal to the change in Gibbs free energy. Wait, but according to the formula:\n\nΔG = w_non-PV (non-expansion work) at constant T and P.\n\nWait, but according to the textbook, the Gibbs energy change is equal to the maximum non-expansion work. However, the sign might be important. Wait, in the derivation:\n\nUnder conditions of constant pressure and temperature, the maximum work done by the system (excluding expansion work) is equal to ΔG. Wait, no, actually, the relation is:\n\nΔG = w_e (non-expansion work), but with the sign.\n\nWait, here's a source: The change in Gibbs free energy for a process is equal to the maximum non-expansion work obtainable from the process at constant temperature and pressure. So ΔG = w_non-expansion (max). But wait, if ΔG is negative, then the system can do work on the surroundings, so the work done by the system is negative ΔG. Wait, confusion arises here.\n\nWait, let's think of it this way: The first law says ΔU = q + w. If we separate work into expansion work (w_exp) and other work (w_other), then w = w_exp + w_other. At constant pressure, the expansion work is -PΔV. Then, considering ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. But under reversible conditions, q_rev = TΔS. Then, ΔG = ΔH - q_rev. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is:\n\nAt constant T and P, the maximum non-expansion work is equal to the decrease in Gibbs energy: w_other, max = ΔG.\n\nWait, no. Wait, here's a better approach. From the definition of Gibbs energy:\n\ndG = VdP - SdT + dw_other (for a reversible process)\n\nAt constant P and T, dG = dw_other, max. So the change in Gibbs energy is equal to the maximum non-expansion work. So ΔG = w_other, max. But here, if ΔG is negative, that means the system can do work on the surroundings. So the maximum non-expansion work obtainable is equal to -ΔG. Wait, no:\n\nWait, if ΔG is negative, then the system's Gibbs energy decreases, so the work done by the system is equal to -ΔG. Let's take an example. If ΔG = -100 kJ, then the system can do 100 kJ of non-expansion work. So the maximum work is equal to -ΔG. Wait, so:\n\nw_max_non-expansion = -ΔG\n\nWait, but according to the differential form, dG = dw_other, max. But if G decreases by 100 kJ, then dG = -100 kJ, so dw_other, max = -100 kJ, which would mean that the work done by the system is -dG. Wait, but the sign here depends on the convention of work. In physics, work done by the system is negative, but in chemistry, usually, work done by the system is negative. Wait, confusion.\n\nWait, according to IUPAC conventions, work done on the system is positive. So expansion work: if the system expands, work done by the system is negative. Then, dw_other would be work done on the system. Hmm, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, refer to the formula:\n\nUnder constant T and P, the non-expansion work done by the system is equal to the decrease in Gibbs energy. So:\n\nw_non-expansion = -ΔG\n\nWait, here's a source: \"The change in Gibbs energy during a process at constant temperature and pressure is equal to the negative of the maximum non-expansion work that can be done by the system.\" If that's the case, then:\n\nw_non-expansion = -ΔG\n\nSo if ΔG is negative, then w_non-expansion is positive, meaning work is done by the system.\n\nSo in our case, ΔG° for the reaction is -818 kJ/mol. Then, the maximum non-expansion work would be -ΔG = 818 kJ/mol. Which would be the work done by the system. Since the question asks for the maximum non-expansion work that may be obtained, this would be 818 kJ per mole of methane combusted.\n\nWait, but in the fuel cell, the reaction is harnessed to do electrical work, which is non-expansion. So the maximum possible electrical work is equal to the negative of ΔG. So yes, 818 kJ/mol.\n\nBut wait, let me check again. If ΔG is negative, the reaction is spontaneous, and the system can do work on the surroundings. The magnitude of ΔG is the maximum non-expansion work possible. So if ΔG° = -818 kJ per mole of reaction, then the maximum non-expansion work obtainable is 818 kJ per mole of reaction.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"per mole\", so per mole of what? The reaction as written consumes one mole of methane. So per mole of methane combusted, the work done is 818 kJ. But since work done by the system is positive, so the answer is 818 kJ/mol.\n\nBut wait, in the calculation, ΔG° came out to be -818.00 kJ/mol. So the maximum non-expansion work is equal to negative ΔG°, so 818.00 kJ/mol.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 818 kJ/mol. But wait, wait, wait. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nΔG° = [(-394.36) + 2*(-237.18)] - [(-50.72) + 2*0]\n\nCalculating products:\n\n-394.36 + 2*(-237.18) = -394.36 - 474.36 = -868.72\n\nReactants:\n\n-50.72 + 0 = -50.72\n\nΔG° = -868.72 - (-50.72) = -868.72 + 50.72 = -818.00 kJ/mol\n\nYes, that's correct. So ΔG° is -818.00 kJ per mole of reaction. So the maximum non-expansion work is -ΔG° = 818.00 kJ per mole of reaction. Since the reaction consumes one mole of methane, this is per mole of methane.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 818 kJ mol⁻¹. But wait, wait. Let me check if the units are correct. The problem says the unit is kJ mol⁻¹, so kilojoules per mole. Which is correct here.\n\nBut wait, wait a second. Wait, in some textbooks, the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction would be -818 kJ per mole of reaction. So per mole of reaction extent. Since the reaction equation consumes 1 mole of CH4, so per mole of CH4 combusted.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 818 kJ mol⁻¹. But wait, wait, but wait another thought. The question says \"maximum non-expansion work per mole\". So per mole of what? Probably per mole of the reaction as written, which is per mole of CH4 combusted. Which is exactly what we have.\n\nBut wait, in the calculation, we have ΔG° for the reaction. The Gibbs free energy change for the reaction is -818 kJ per mole of reaction. So per mole of reaction. Since the reaction consumes one mole of CH4, so per mole of CH4 combusted. So the answer is 818 kJ per mole of CH4 combusted.\n\nBut the problem says \"the combustion of methane\", so per mole of methane combusted. Which is exactly what we have. So the answer is 818 kJ mol⁻¹.\n\nWait, but wait another thing. Let me check the standard Gibbs free energy of formation values again. Because if I use different values, the answer might change slightly. Let me confirm the numbers.\n\nFor example, another source might list ΔGf° of H2O(l) as -237.13 kJ/mol, and CO2(g) as -394.4 kJ/mol, and CH4(g) as -50.79 kJ/mol. Let's see:\n\nUsing these numbers:\n\nΔG° = [(-394.4) + 2*(-237.13)] - (-50.79)\n\n= (-394.4 - 474.26) + 50.79\n\n= (-868.66) + 50.79 = -817.87 ≈ -818 kJ/mol\n\nSo still rounds to -818. So regardless of slight variations in decimal places, the answer is -818 kJ/mol. So the maximum non-expansion work is 818 kJ/mol.\n\nBut wait, another thought. The problem states \"all gases are perfect\". Does that affect the calculation? Well, the Gibbs free energy of formation values given are for ideal gases. So if the gases are perfect, then the ideal gas Gibbs energies are valid, so our calculation is okay. Also, the activity of pure gases at 1 bar (assuming standard states are 1 bar), but since the problem says data refer to 298.15 K, and assuming standard pressure is 1 bar. But the calculation remains the same.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 818 kJ mol⁻¹.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, in some sources, the value for the Gibbs free energy change for the combustion of methane is given as -818 kJ/mol, so the maximum work obtainable is 818 kJ per mole. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, wait another thing. In a fuel cell, the reaction is divided into oxidation and reduction half-reactions. The electrical work done is related to the cell potential. The relation between ΔG and cell potential E is ΔG = -nFE, where n is moles of electrons transferred, F is Faraday's constant. Then, the electrical work is nFE per mole of reaction. But regardless of the electrochemical approach, the maximum work is still ΔG. So regardless of the method, the answer should be the ΔG calculated here.\n\nTherefore, I think my calculation is correct. So the answer is 818 kJ mol⁻¹.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check another source. For example, the enthalpy of combustion of methane is about -890 kJ/mol, which is ΔH. And ΔG is less negative, but in our calculation, ΔG is -818. So that seems plausible. The difference between ΔH and ΔG is TΔS. Anyway, the calculation here is correct based on the given ΔGf° values.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 818 kJ mol⁻¹.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe maximum non-expansion work per mole is \\boxed{818} $\\mathrm{kJ} \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n<\n</think>\n\nTo determine the **maximum non-expansion work per mole** that can be obtained from the **combustion of methane** in a fuel cell at **298 K**, we apply the principle that the **maximum non-expansion work** (such as electrical work in a fuel cell) is equal to the **negative of the standard Gibbs free energy change** of the reaction:\n\n$$\nw_{\\text{max, non-expansion}} = -\\Delta G^\\circ\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Write the Balanced Chemical Equation\n\nThe combustion of methane is:\n\n$$\n\\text{CH}_4(g) + 2\\,\\text{O}_2(g) \\rightarrow \\text{CO}_2(g) + 2\\,\\text{H}_2\\text{O}(l)\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use Standard Gibbs Free Energies of Formation\n\nWe use the standard Gibbs free energies of formation (ΔGf°) at 298 K:\n\n- ΔGf°(CH₄, g) = -50.72 kJ/mol  \n- ΔGf°(O₂, g) = 0 kJ/mol (standard state)  \n- ΔGf°(CO₂, g) = -394.36 kJ/mol  \n- ΔGf°(H₂O, l) = -237.18 kJ/mol  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Gibbs Free Energy Change Formula\n\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ = \\sum \\Delta G_f^\\circ(\\text{products}) - \\sum \\Delta G_f^\\circ(\\text{reactants})\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ = [(-394.36) + 2(-237.18)] - [(-50.72) + 2(0)]\n$$\n\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\circ = (-394.36 - 474.36) - (-50.72) = -868.72 + 50.72 = -818.00\\ \\text{kJ/mol}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Maximum Non-Expansion Work\n\nSince the maximum non-expansion work is:\n\n$$\nw_{\\text{max, non-expansion}} = -\\Delta G^\\circ = -(-818.00) = 818.00\\ \\text{kJ/mol}\n$$\n\nThis is the **maximum electrical work** that can be obtained per mole of methane combusted in a fuel cell under standard conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{818}\\ \\mathrm{kJ} \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\n$$", "elapsed_time": 610.91}

The problem gives me the enthalpy of vaporization and the boiling point. Let me recall what I know about entropy changes during phase transitions.\n\nFirst, I remember that at the boiling point, the process of vaporization is reversible because the liquid and vapor are in equilibrium. For a reversible process, the entropy change of the system can be calculated using ΔS = ΔH / T, where ΔH is the enthalpy change and T is the temperature in Kelvin. But wait, the question asks for the entropy change of the surroundings, not the system. Hmm, right, so I need to be careful here.\n\nIn thermodynamics, the total entropy change (system + surroundings) for a reversible process is zero. That's because the process is at equilibrium. So, ΔS_total = ΔS_system + ΔS_surroundings = 0. Therefore, ΔS_surroundings = -ΔS_system.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The entropy change of the surroundings is related to the heat transferred to the surroundings. When a substance vaporizes, it absorbs heat from the surroundings (if the process is endothermic). Wait, the enthalpy of vaporization is given as 29.4 kJ/mol. Since vaporization is endothermic, the system absorbs heat, which means the surroundings lose heat. Therefore, the entropy change of the surroundings should be negative, right?\n\nBut let me get this straight. The enthalpy of vaporization (ΔH_vap) is the amount of heat absorbed by the system at constant pressure. Since the system is absorbing heat, the surroundings are losing that heat. So, the heat transferred to the surroundings is -ΔH_vap. But entropy change for the surroundings would be Q_surroundings / T, where Q_surroundings is the heat transferred to the surroundings.\n\nWait, yes. The heat released by the system to the surroundings would be -Q, so if the system absorbs heat Q, then surroundings lose Q. So, Q_surr = -ΔH_vap. Then ΔS_surr = Q_surr / T = (-ΔH_vap) / T.\n\nWait, but the temperature here should be the temperature of the surroundings? Or the system? Hmm, in the case of a phase transition at equilibrium, the temperature of the system and surroundings should be the same, right? Because they are in thermal equilibrium. So the temperature T here is the boiling point given, 334.88 K.\n\nTherefore, the entropy change of the surroundings should be equal to -ΔH_vap / T. Wait, but wait again. Let me make sure.\n\nThe entropy change of the system (chloroform) when it vaporizes would be ΔS_system = ΔH_vap / T, since it's absorbing heat. Then, the entropy change of the surroundings would be the opposite, because the heat lost by surroundings is equal to the heat gained by the system. So ΔS_surroundings = -ΔH_vap / T.\n\nWait, but the sign here might be tripping me. Let's clarify:\n\nΔS_system = +ΔH_vap / T (since the system is absorbing heat, its entropy increases)\n\nThe surroundings are losing heat, so their entropy change should be negative:\n\nΔS_surroundings = -ΔH_vap / T\n\nBut wait, the formula for entropy change of surroundings is Q_rev,surr / T_surr. Since the heat exchanged with surroundings is -Q (where Q is heat into the system), so Q_surr = -Q_sys. Since Q_sys at constant pressure is ΔH, then Q_surr = -ΔH.\n\nSo ΔS_surroundings = Q_surr / T = (-ΔH)/T.\n\nYes, so in this case, ΔS_surroundings = -ΔH_vap / T.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nΔH_vap = 29.4 kJ/mol = 29400 J/mol\n\nTemperature T = 334.88 K\n\nSo ΔS_surroundings = -29400 J/mol / 334.88 K\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, divide 29400 by 334.88.\n\nLet me compute 29400 ÷ 334.88.\n\nLet me approximate:\n\n334.88 × 80 = 334.88 × 80 = 26,790.4\n\n334.88 × 87 = 26,790.4 + (334.88 × 7) = 26,790.4 + 2,344.16 = 29,134.56\n\nThat's 87. 334.88 × 87.8 = ?\n\nWait, 29,134.56 + 334.88 × 0.8 = 29,134.56 + 267.904 = 29,402.464\n\nSo 334.88 × 87.8 ≈ 29,402.464, which is very close to 29,400.\n\nTherefore, 29,400 / 334.88 ≈ approximately 87.8.\n\nBut since 334.88 × 87.8 ≈ 29,402.46, which is just a bit over 29,400, so maybe 87.8 minus a little.\n\nSo approximately 87.8 - (2.46 / 334.88) ≈ 87.8 - 0.007 ≈ 87.793.\n\nWait, but wait, this is 29,400 / 334.88. Wait, but 29,400 is 29400, and 29,402.46 is 334.88 × 87.8, so 29,400 is 2.46 less. So 87.8 - (2.46 / 334.88). Since 2.46 / 334.88 ≈ 0.0073, so ≈ 87.7927.\n\nBut since the value is negative, ΔS_surroundings ≈ -87.8 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.\n\nWait, but wait, the exact calculation:\n\nLet me use calculator steps:\n\n29400 divided by 334.88.\n\nLet me compute 29400 / 334.88.\n\nFirst, divide numerator and denominator by 4: 7350 / 83.72 ≈ ?\n\nHmm, 83.72 × 87 = 83 × 87 + 0.72 × 87 = 7221 + 62.64 = 7283.64\n\nWait, 83.72 × 80 = 6,697.6\n\n83.72 × 7 = 586.04\n\nSo 83.72 × 87 = 6,697.6 + 586.04 = 7,283.64\n\nBut 83.72 × 87.7 = 7,283.64 + 83.72 × 0.7 = 7,283.64 + 58.604 = 7,342.244\n\nWait, but we have 7350 / 83.72. Wait, this approach might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, use decimal division.\n\nCompute 29400 ÷ 334.88.\n\nLet me write 334.88 × 80 = 26,790.4\n\nSubtract that from 29,400: 29,400 - 26,790.4 = 2,609.6\n\nNow, 334.88 × 7 = 2,344.16\n\nSubtract from 2,609.6: 2,609.6 - 2,344.16 = 265.44\n\nNow, 334.88 × 0.8 = 267.904\n\nSo 0.8 gives 267.904, which is a bit more than 265.44.\n\nSo 0.8 - (267.904 - 265.44)/334.88 per unit?\n\nWait, 265.44 / 334.88 ≈ 0.792\n\nWait, 334.88 × 0.79 = 334.88 × 0.7 + 334.88 × 0.09 = 234.416 + 30.1392 = 264.5552\n\nWhich is very close to 265.44. The difference is 265.44 - 264.5552 = 0.8848.\n\nSo 0.79 + (0.8848 / 334.88) ≈ 0.79 + 0.0026 ≈ 0.7926.\n\nSo total multiplier is 80 + 7 + 0.7926 ≈ 87.7926.\n\nSo approximately 87.79.\n\nSo 29400 / 334.88 ≈ 87.79 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.\n\nBut since the entropy change of surroundings is negative, this would be -87.79 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. The enthalpy of vaporization is positive because it's the heat absorbed by the system. The surroundings lose heat, so Q_surr = -29.4 kJ/mol. Then ΔS_surr = Q_surr / T = (-29.4e3 J/mol) / 334.88 K = -87.79 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.\n\nSo rounding to an appropriate number of significant figures. The given data has three significant figures: 29.4 kJ/mol (three sig figs) and 334.88 K (five sig figs). So the least number of sig figs is three, so the answer should be three sig figs.\n\n-87.79 rounds to -87.8 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.\n\nWait, but 29.4 has three, temperature has five. So yes, three sig figs. So -87.8.\n\nBut wait, let me check the exact calculation:\n\n29.4 kJ/mol = 29400 J/mol.\n\n29400 divided by 334.88:\n\nLet me compute 29400 / 334.88.\n\nLet me use calculator steps:\n\n334.88 × 87 = ?\n\n334.88 × 80 = 26,790.4\n\n334.88 × 7 = 2,344.16\n\nTotal: 26,790.4 + 2,344.16 = 29,134.56\n\nDifference: 29,400 - 29,134.56 = 265.44\n\nNow, 265.44 / 334.88 = ?\n\nLet's divide numerator and denominator by 16:\n\n265.44 / 16 = 16.59\n\n334.88 / 16 = 20.93\n\nNot helpful. Alternatively:\n\n334.88 × 0.7 = 234.416\n\n334.88 × 0.8 = 267.904\n\nSo 0.7 gives 234.416, which is less than 265.44.\n\nWait, wait, 265.44 ÷ 334.88.\n\nWait, 265.44 / 334.88 = (approx) 0.792.\n\nYes, because 0.792 × 334.88 = 0.7 × 334.88 = 234.416; 0.09 × 334.88 = 30.1392; 0.002 × 334.88 = 0.66976. So 234.416 + 30.1392 = 264.5552 + 0.66976 = 265.22496. Close to 265.44. So 0.792 gives 265.225, difference is 265.44 - 265.225 = 0.215.\n\nSo 0.215 / 334.88 ≈ 0.000642.\n\nSo total multiplier is 0.792 + 0.000642 ≈ 0.7926.\n\nSo total is 87 + 0.7926 = 87.7926.\n\nSo 87.7926 ≈ 87.79 J/K/mol.\n\nBut since the value is negative, -87.79 ≈ -87.8 when rounded to three significant figures.\n\nWait, but 29.4 has three, so the answer should be three. So -87.8 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.\n\nBut wait, let me check with a calculator for more accuracy.\n\nAlternatively, use decimal division:\n\nCompute 29400 ÷ 334.88.\n\nLet me write this as 29400 ÷ 334.88.\n\nLet me convert this into division by a whole number by multiplying numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals:\n\n(29400 × 100) / (33488) = 2,940,000 / 33,488.\n\nNow, divide numerator and denominator by 8:\n\n2,940,000 ÷ 8 = 367,500\n\n33,488 ÷ 8 = 4,186\n\nSo now 367,500 ÷ 4,186.\n\nLet me compute 4,186 × 87 = ?\n\n4,000 × 87 = 348,000\n\n186 × 87: 100×87=8,700; 80×87=6,960; 6×87=522. Total: 8,700 + 6,960 = 15,660 + 522 = 16,182\n\nTotal 4,186 × 87 = 348,000 + 16,182 = 364,182\n\nSubtract from 367,500: 367,500 - 364,182 = 3,318\n\nNow, 4,186 × 0.8 = 3,348.8\n\nBut 3,318 is less than that. So 0.7 times:\n\n4,186 × 0.7 = 2,930.2\n\nSo 3,318 - 2,930.2 = 387.8\n\nSo total multiplier is 87 + 0.7 = 87.7, with a remainder of 387.8.\n\nNow, 387.8 / 4,186 ≈ 0.0926\n\nSo total is approximately 87.7 + 0.0926 ≈ 87.7926.\n\nSame as before. So ≈87.79.\n\nSo again, -87.79 ≈ -87.8 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.\n\nSo the entropy change of the surroundings is -87.8 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me confirm once more the sign. The enthalpy of vaporization is energy required to vaporize the liquid, so the system absorbs heat, surroundings lose heat. Therefore, the entropy change of surroundings should be negative. Correct.\n\nAlternatively, the entropy change of the system is positive (since going from liquid to gas, more disorder), surroundings lose heat, their entropy decreases. So yes, surroundings entropy change is negative.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, the entropy change of the universe (system + surroundings) should be zero for a reversible process. Wait, but vaporization at the boiling point is a reversible process. Therefore:\n\nΔS_univ = ΔS_sys + ΔS_surr = 0\n\nTherefore, ΔS_surr = -ΔS_sys\n\nWe know ΔS_sys = ΔH_vap / T = 29,400 J/mol / 334.88 K = +87.8 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹\n\nTherefore, ΔS_surr = -87.8 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹. Which matches our previous calculation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is -87.8 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, if ΔS_univ = 0, then ΔS_surr must be negative of ΔS_sys. Which is exactly what we have here.\n\nΔS_sys = 29.4e3 / 334.88 ≈ 87.8 J/K/mol\n\nΔS_surr = -87.8 J/K/mol\n\nSo the total entropy change is zero. Makes sense for a reversible process.\n\nTherefore, the entropy change of the surroundings is -87.8 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"calculate the entropy change of the surroundings\". So the answer should be negative. But let me check if the question is asking for magnitude. No, no, the entropy change should be negative here.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, in the process of vaporization, the system's entropy increases (positive ΔS_sys), and the surroundings lose heat, so their entropy decreases (negative ΔS_surr). So yes, the answer is negative.\n\nBut let me check units again. The problem states the unit should be J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹, which we have.\n\nSo final answer: \\boxed{-87.8} J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check the calculation again. 29.4 kJ/mol is 29400 J/mol.\n\n29400 divided by 334.88.\n\nLet me use calculator-like steps:\n\n334.88 × 80 = 26,790.4\n\n29400 - 26,790.4 = 2,609.6\n\n334.88 × 7 = 2,344.16\n\n2,609.6 - 2,344.16 = 265.44\n\n334.88 × 0.8 = 267.904\n\nBut 265.44 < 267.904, so 0.8 - (267.904 - 265.44)/334.88 ?\n\nWait, no. How much is 265.44 / 334.88?\n\nIt's 0.792 approximately.\n\nSo total multiplier: 80 + 7 + 0.792 = 87.792.\n\nSo 87.792, so 87.8 when rounded to three significant figures.\n\nSo yes, -87.8.\n\nBut wait, the given temperature is 334.88 K, which is five significant figures, but the enthalpy is three. So three sig figs is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{-87.8} J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, wait another thought.

The temperature is 298 K and the pressure is 1.00 bar initially. Hmm, let me start by recalling some thermodynamics concepts.\n\nFirst, the problem states that the process is adiabatic and reversible. I remember that in an adiabatic process, there's no heat exchange with the surroundings, so q = 0. Therefore, the change in entropy of the system should be zero? Wait, but wait, entropy is a state function, so maybe I need to consider the entropy change of the system and surroundings? Wait, no, in an adiabatic reversible process, the total entropy change (system + surroundings) is zero. But since the process is reversible, the entropy change of the system would be zero? Hmm, but wait, the question asks for the total change in entropy. If it's a reversible process, then the total entropy change should be zero. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Wait, the problem says \"total change in entropy\"—does that refer to the system only or the system plus surroundings? Hmm. Let me check the question again.\n\n\"Calculate the total change in entropy, when a sample of nitrogen gas of mass 14 g at 298 K and 1.00 bar doubles its volume in an adiabatic reversible expansion.\"\n\nHmm, in thermodynamics, sometimes \"total entropy change\" refers to the sum of the system and surroundings. In a reversible process, the total entropy change should be zero. But in an irreversible process, it's positive. Since this is a reversible process, then the total entropy change (system + surroundings) is zero. But maybe the question is asking for the entropy change of the system? Wait, but the wording says \"total\", which might imply system plus surroundings. Hmm. Wait, but maybe in some contexts, \"total entropy change\" refers to the system. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, but let's think again.\n\nIn an adiabatic process, q = 0, so the entropy change of the system is... Wait, entropy change is not necessarily zero even if q=0. Wait, entropy change is equal to q_rev / T. But in an adiabatic process, q_rev = 0, so the entropy change of the system should be zero. But wait, that's only for a reversible adiabatic process. Because in a reversible process, the entropy change of the system is equal to q_rev / T. Since q_rev = 0, then ΔS_system = 0. Then, since the process is reversible, the entropy change of surroundings would also be zero, so total ΔS = 0. But then why is the question asking for the total entropy change? Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"when a sample of nitrogen gas... doubles its volume in an adiabatic reversible expansion.\" So if the process is adiabatic and reversible, then the entropy change of the system should be zero. And since it's adiabatic, the surroundings don't exchange heat either, so their entropy change is zero. Therefore, total entropy change is zero. But maybe the problem is trying to trick me? Or perhaps I'm misapplying the concepts here.\n\nWait, but wait another thought. If the process is adiabatic and the volume changes, then the temperature must change as well. In an adiabatic expansion, the temperature of the gas will drop. However, entropy is a function of state, so the entropy change of the system can be calculated using the initial and final states, regardless of the process. But in a reversible adiabatic process, the entropy change of the system is zero. However, if the process were irreversible, then the entropy change of the system would be positive, and the surroundings would have a negative entropy change (if heat was exchanged), but in adiabatic irreversible, the total entropy would increase.\n\nBut in this problem, the process is reversible. Therefore, ΔS_system = 0. Then total entropy change (system + surroundings) is zero. But the problem says \"calculate the total change in entropy\". Hmm. Maybe the problem is using \"total\" to refer to the system? Or maybe there's a mistake in the problem? Or perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, but let's think again. Let's suppose that the problem is asking for the entropy change of the system. If that's the case, then in an adiabatic reversible process, ΔS_system = 0. But wait, entropy change is given by ΔS = nR ln(Vf / Vi) + (C_v / T) dT. Wait, but in general, entropy change for an ideal gas can be calculated using:\n\nΔS = nC_v ln(T_f / T_i) + nR ln(V_f / V_i)\n\nOr alternatively:\n\nΔS = nC_p ln(T_f / T_i) - nR ln(P_f / P_i)\n\nBut in an adiabatic process, we have relations between T and V. For a reversible adiabatic expansion, the process is isentropic (ΔS = 0). Therefore, the entropy change of the system is zero. Therefore, regardless of the volume change, if the process is adiabatic and reversible, the entropy change of the system is zero, and the total entropy change (system + surroundings) is zero.\n\nBut then why is the problem giving all the data? The mass of nitrogen, the initial temperature, pressure, etc. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Wait, perhaps the problem is not a reversible adiabatic process? No, it says \"adiabatic reversible expansion\". Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is trying to trick me into thinking that because the volume changes, there should be an entropy change, but in reality, in a reversible adiabatic process, entropy change is zero. Hmm. Let me check some references.\n\nWait, according to thermodynamics, in a reversible adiabatic process, the entropy change of the system is zero. Because dS = dq_rev / T, and since dq_rev = 0, integrating gives ΔS = 0. Therefore, the entropy change of the system is zero. Then the total entropy change (system + surroundings) is zero. So regardless of the details of the process, the answer should be zero. But why give the mass, initial temperature, pressure, etc.?\n\nWait, unless the problem is not a reversible adiabatic process, but the question says \"adiabatic reversible expansion\". Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem is mixing concepts. Wait, but if the process is adiabatic and reversible, then ΔS_system = 0. If the process is adiabatic and irreversible, then ΔS_system > 0, but since it's reversible, ΔS_system = 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not adiabatic? No, it says adiabatic. Hmm. Maybe the problem is wrong? Or perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, but let's suppose that the problem is expecting me to calculate the entropy change of the system using the formula for entropy change when volume changes, ignoring the temperature change? But that would be incorrect. Because in an adiabatic expansion, the temperature changes. But in the entropy change formula, you have to take into account both the volume and temperature change.\n\nWait, but if the process is adiabatic and reversible, then the entropy change must be zero. Therefore, the entropy change formula:\n\nΔS = nC_v ln(T_f / T_i) + nR ln(V_f / V_i) = 0\n\nTherefore, we can relate T_f and T_i based on the volume change. For a reversible adiabatic process, TV^{γ-1} = constant. For nitrogen gas, which is diatomic, γ = Cp/Cv = 7/5 / (5/2 R?) Wait, no. Wait, for diatomic gases, Cv,m = (5/2)R (since translational + rotational contributions), Cp,m = (7/2)R, so γ = Cp/Cv = 7/5 = 1.4.\n\nSo TV^{γ-1} = constant. So T_initial * V_initial^{γ-1} = T_final * V_final^{γ-1}\n\nGiven that V_final = 2 V_initial, so:\n\nT_final = T_initial * (V_initial / V_final)^{γ-1} = 298 K * (1/2)^{0.4}\n\nBut regardless, if the entropy change is zero, then the answer is zero. But why give all the data? Maybe the problem is not adiabatic? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the problem is misstated? Or perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"doubles its volume in an adiabatic reversible expansion\". So the process is adiabatic and reversible. Then, according to the second law, ΔS_system = 0. And since it's adiabatic, no heat is exchanged with surroundings, so ΔS_surroundings = 0. Therefore, total entropy change is zero.\n\nBut then why give the mass of nitrogen? Maybe the problem is in fact not adiabatic? Or maybe the question is a trick question. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to an isothermal expansion? But no, it says adiabatic.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is expecting me to calculate the entropy change of the system assuming it's isothermal, but that would be wrong. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is mixing up adiabatic and other processes. Wait, but let's try to think again.\n\nSuppose that the problem is correct, and we have to compute the entropy change of the system. Even though the process is adiabatic and reversible, which implies ΔS_system = 0, but maybe the problem is considering that the expansion is against a vacuum (free expansion), which is adiabatic but irreversible. In that case, the entropy change of the system would be positive, and since it's adiabatic, the entropy change of surroundings is zero, so total entropy change is positive. But the problem says \"reversible expansion\", so it's not a free expansion.\n\nWait, so in summary:\n\n- Adiabatic reversible process: ΔS_system = 0.\n\n- Adiabatic irreversible process: ΔS_system > 0.\n\nBut the problem says \"adiabatic reversible expansion\", so ΔS_system = 0, and since it's adiabatic, surroundings have no entropy change. So total ΔS = 0.\n\nBut the problem gives data about nitrogen gas, mass, initial temperature, pressure, volume doubling. If the answer is zero, why give all that data? Maybe the problem is not a reversible process? Or maybe the question is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to an isothermal expansion? Hmm.\n\nWait, but let's suppose that the problem is correct, and I need to calculate the entropy change of the system. Let's proceed with the calculation. Let's recall that entropy is a state function, so regardless of the process, the entropy change depends only on initial and final states. So if I can find the initial and final states, I can compute ΔS.\n\nGiven that the gas undergoes an adiabatic reversible expansion where the volume doubles. Let's find the initial and final states.\n\nFirst, the initial state:\n\nMass of nitrogen gas: 14 g. Nitrogen gas is N2, molar mass M = 28.0 g/mol. So moles n = 14 / 28 = 0.5 mol.\n\nInitial temperature T_i = 298 K, initial pressure P_i = 1.00 bar, initial volume V_i.\n\nFinal volume V_f = 2 V_i.\n\nProcess: adiabatic reversible expansion.\n\nFinal state: ?\n\nIn a reversible adiabatic expansion, the relation between V and T is given by:\n\nT_i * V_i^{γ-1} = T_f * V_f^{γ-1}\n\nwhere γ = Cp/Cv.\n\nFor diatomic gas, as mentioned, Cv,m = (5/2)R, Cp,m = (7/2)R, so γ = 7/5 = 1.4.\n\nTherefore, γ - 1 = 0.4.\n\nSo,\n\nT_f = T_i * (V_i / V_f)^{γ-1} = 298 K * (1/2)^{0.4}\n\nCompute (1/2)^{0.4}:\n\nTake natural logarithm: ln(0.5^{0.4}) = 0.4 * ln(0.5) ≈ 0.4 * (-0.6931) ≈ -0.2772\n\nExponentiate: e^{-0.2772} ≈ 0.757\n\nTherefore, T_f ≈ 298 * 0.757 ≈ 225.7 K\n\nSo the final temperature is about 225.7 K.\n\nNow, to compute the entropy change of the system, even though the process is adiabatic and reversible, we can use the formula for entropy change of an ideal gas:\n\nΔS = nCv ln(T_f / T_i) + nR ln(V_f / V_i)\n\nWait, but in reality, since the process is reversible and adiabatic, this should equal zero. Let's check:\n\nCompute each term.\n\nCv for nitrogen (diatomic gas) is (5/2)R per mole.\n\nn = 0.5 mol\n\nT_f / T_i = 0.757\n\nln(T_f / T_i) = ln(0.757) ≈ -0.278\n\nFirst term: 0.5 * (5/2)*R * (-0.278)\n\nR = 8.314 J/mol K\n\nFirst term: 0.5 * 2.5 * 8.314 * (-0.278) ≈ 0.5 * 2.5 * 8.314 * (-0.278)\n\nCalculate step by step:\n\n0.5 * 2.5 = 1.25\n\n1.25 * 8.314 ≈ 10.3925\n\n10.3925 * (-0.278) ≈ -2.89 J/K\n\nSecond term: nR ln(V_f / V_i) = 0.5 * 8.314 * ln(2) ≈ 0.5 * 8.314 * 0.693 ≈ 0.5 * 5.765 ≈ 2.88 J/K\n\nAdding both terms: -2.89 + 2.88 ≈ -0.01 J/K, which is approximately zero. Considering rounding errors, this is effectively zero. Therefore, ΔS_system ≈ 0.\n\nTherefore, the entropy change of the system is zero. Then, since the process is adiabatic, the surroundings exchange no heat, so ΔS_surroundings = 0. Therefore, total entropy change is zero.\n\nBut the problem gives all the data, so maybe the question is expecting me to compute the entropy change of the system, not knowing that in a reversible adiabatic process it's zero? But according to the calculation, it's zero. Alternatively, if someone forgets that the temperature changes and just naively applies ΔS = nR ln(Vf / Vi), they would get ΔS = 0.5 * 8.314 * ln(2) ≈ 2.88 J/K, but that's incorrect because temperature also changes.\n\nBut according to the calculation, the entropy change is zero. Therefore, the answer should be zero.\n\nBut why does the problem mention \"total change in entropy\"? Maybe in some contexts, \"total\" refers to the system plus surroundings. In that case, still zero. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the process were not adiabatic, but the problem says it is. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. If so, then the answer is zero.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's check again.\n\nEntropy change of the system: zero.\n\nEntropy change of surroundings: zero, because no heat is exchanged with surroundings (adiabatic).\n\nTotal: zero.\n\nAlternatively, if the process were irreversible, then ΔS_system > 0, but since it's reversible, ΔS_total = 0.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be zero.\n\nBut the problem gives all the data. Maybe the problem is in error? Or maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is not saying that the process is adiabatic and reversible, but that it's adiabatic and the expansion is reversible. Which is the same thing. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the total entropy change of the system, considering that the process is adiabatic but irreversible. But the problem says \"reversible\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is not a quasi-static process? No, reversible processes are quasi-static.\n\nHmm. I think the answer must be zero. But to make sure, let's see.\n\nSuppose someone is confused and thinks that even in an adiabatic process, if the volume changes, there's an entropy change. But in reality, in a reversible adiabatic process, entropy change is zero. In an irreversible adiabatic process, entropy change of the system is positive.\n\nBut the problem says \"reversible\", so ΔS_system = 0.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"isothermal reversible expansion\", then ΔS_system = nR ln(Vf / Vi), and since heat would be absorbed from surroundings, ΔS_surroundings = -nR ln(Vf / Vi), so total ΔS = 0. But in that case, temperature is constant.\n\nBut in this problem, temperature changes.\n\nAlternatively, if the process were free expansion (adiabatic, irreversible), then ΔS_system would be nR ln(Vf / Vi), since temperature remains constant for ideal gas in free expansion? Wait, no. Wait, in a free expansion (adiabatic), no heat exchange, no work done (if it's against vacuum), so internal energy change is zero (for ideal gas), so temperature remains constant. Wait, that's Joule expansion. Wait, for an ideal gas, internal energy is a function of temperature only, so if the process is adiabatic free expansion (no work done, no heat exchange), ΔU = 0, so temperature remains constant.\n\nIn that case, entropy change of system is nR ln(Vf / Vi), positive. Entropy change of surroundings is zero, since no heat exchanged. So total entropy change is positive.\n\nBut in this problem, the process is reversible, not free expansion.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, it says \"doubles its volume in an adiabatic reversible expansion\". So if it's a reversible expansion, then it's not a free expansion. The gas is doing work, and since it's adiabatic, the internal energy decreases, so temperature drops.\n\nBut regardless, the entropy change of the system in a reversible adiabatic process is zero.\n\nSo, given all that, the answer should be zero.\n\nBut why give all the data? Let me check the problem again.\n\n\"Calculate the total change in entropy, when a sample of nitrogen gas of mass 14 g at 298 K and 1.00 bar doubles its volume in an adiabatic reversible expansion.\"\n\nSo mass is 14 g. Molar mass N2 is 28, so n = 0.5 mol. Volume doubles. Reversible adiabatic. So according to theory, ΔS_system = 0.\n\nBut maybe the problem intended to say \"isothermal\" instead of \"adiabatic\"? In that case, ΔS_system = nR ln(2) = 0.5 * 8.314 * ln(2) ≈ 2.88 J/K, and if the process is isothermal and reversible, then ΔS_total = 0. But the problem says adiabatic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a non-ideal gas? But it says \"assume all gases are perfect\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to calculate the entropy change of the surroundings? But in an adiabatic process, no heat exchange, so surroundings entropy change is zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question testing the knowledge that ΔS = 0 in reversible adiabatic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is not in English and \"total\" refers to something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from a source where \"total entropy change\" refers to the system even in other contexts. But in that case, ΔS_system = 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is wrong. But given the information, I think the answer is zero.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's recast the problem. Suppose that someone doesn't recall that reversible adiabatic processes are isentropic. How would they approach it?\n\nThey would use the formula for entropy change of an ideal gas:\n\nΔS = nC_p ln(T_f / T_i) - nR ln(P_f / P_i)\n\nOr ΔS = nC_v ln(T_f / T_i) + nR ln(V_f / V_i)\n\nEither way. But to use these formulas, you need to know T_f and P_f.\n\nIn an adiabatic process, Q = 0, so ΔU = W.\n\nFor a diatomic gas:\n\nΔU = nCvΔT = -P_ext dV (but for reversible, P_ext = P at each step)\n\nWork done in reversible adiabatic expansion:\n\nW = ∫ P dV from V_i to V_f\n\nBut for adiabatic reversible, PV^γ = constant.\n\nSo P_i V_i^γ = P_f V_f^γ\n\nAnd we can relate T and V.\n\nBut regardless, if we use the entropy formula:\n\nΔS = nCv ln(T_f / T_i) + nR ln(V_f / V_i)\n\nBut in a reversible adiabatic process, this must equal zero. So even if you calculate using the relation between T_f and V_f, you get ΔS = 0.\n\nAlternatively, if you didn't know that, you could compute T_f as I did earlier, plug into the entropy formula, and find ΔS ≈ 0.\n\nSo in conclusion, the total entropy change is zero.\n\nBut the problem gives all the data. Maybe the problem had a typo, and it was supposed to be an isothermal process, or a free expansion. But given the problem as stated, the answer should be zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the gas is expanding adiabatically but not reversibly, but the question says \"reversible\".\n\nI think the answer is zero. So boxed answer would be \\boxed{0} J/K.\n\nBut wait, units? Entropy is in J/K. The problem says \"total change in entropy\"—if it's zero, then units are J/K.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects a different answer. Wait, but according to the calculation above, using the formula, we get approximately zero. So I think that's the case.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{0}\n<\n</think>\n\nTo determine the **total change in entropy** for a **reversible adiabatic expansion** of nitrogen gas, we begin by analyzing the thermodynamic nature of the process.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Concepts and Assumptions**\n\n- **Reversible adiabatic process**: No heat is exchanged with the surroundings (adiabatic), and the process is carried out in a quasi-static, reversible manner.\n- **Entropy change in a reversible adiabatic process**: Since the process is both **reversible** and **adiabatic**, the **entropy change of the system is zero**.
