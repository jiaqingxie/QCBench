Wurtzite is a hexagonal crystal system with a specific arrangement of atoms. The unit cell described is a right rhombic prism with:\n- d = 2.54 Å (edge length)\n- e = 3.63 Å (height)\n- Interior angles of 60° and 120°\n\nIn the wurtzite structure:\n- The structure consists of two interpenetrating hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lattices\n- One lattice contains the cations (B³⁺ in this case)\n- The other lattice contains the anions (N³⁻ in this case)\n- The two lattices are offset by 3/8 of the unit cell height along the c-axis\n\nFor a wurtzite unit cell, I need to count the atoms at different positions:\n\n**Boron atoms in the unit cell:**\n\n1. **Corner atoms**: In a hexagonal unit cell, there are 12 corner positions in the hexagonal prism. Each corner atom is shared by 6 adjacent unit cells, so each contributes 1/6 to the unit cell.\n   - Contribution from corners: 12 × (1/6) = 2 atoms\n\n2. **Face atoms**: There are 2 hexagonal faces (top and bottom), each with 1 atom at the center. Each face-centered atom is shared by 2 unit cells, so each contributes 1/2.\n   - Contribution from face centers: 2 × (1/2) = 1 atom\n\n3. **Interior atoms**: In wurtzite, there are additional atoms inside the unit cell at specific fractional coordinates.\n   - There is 1 atom at position (1/3, 2/3, 1/8) and another at (2/3, 1/3, 5/8)\n   - These are fully contained within the unit cell\n   - Contribution from interior: 1 atom\n\nWait, let me reconsider this more carefully. In wurtzite structure:\n\nThe wurtzite structure has 4 formula units per unit cell. Since each formula unit of BN contains 1 boron atom and 1 nitrogen atom, there are 4 boron atoms and 4 nitrogen atoms in the unit cell.\n\nLet me verify this by considering the atomic positions in wurtzite:\n- Boron atoms are located at: (0,0,0), (1/3,2/3,1/2), and their equivalent positions\n- Due to the hexagonal symmetry and the specific wurtzite arrangement, there are exactly 4 boron atoms per unit cell\n\nTherefore, the number of B atoms in the unit cell of w-BN is:\n\n$\\boxed{4}$",

Wurtzite is a hexagonal crystal system with a specific arrangement of atoms. The unit cell described is a right rhombic prism with:\n- d = 2.54 Å (edge length)\n- e = 3.63 Å (height)\n- Interior angles of 60° and 120°\n\nIn the wurtzite structure:\n- The structure consists of two interpenetrating hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lattices\n- One lattice contains the cations (B³⁺ in this case)\n- The other lattice contains the anions (N³⁻ in this case)\n- The two lattices are offset by 3/8 of the unit cell height along the c-axis\n\nFor a wurtzite unit cell, I need to count the atoms at different positions:\n\n**Boron atoms in the unit cell:**\n\n1. **Corner atoms**: In a hexagonal unit cell, there are 12 corner positions in the hexagonal prism. Each corner atom is shared by 6 adjacent unit cells, so each contributes 1/6 to the unit cell.\n   - Contribution from corners: 12 × (1/6) = 2 atoms\n\n2. **Face atoms**: There are 2 hexagonal faces (top and bottom), each with 1 atom at the center. Each face-centered atom is shared by 2 unit cells, so each contributes 1/2.\n   - Contribution from face centers: 2 × (1/2) = 1 atom\n\n3. **Interior atoms**: In wurtzite, there are additional atoms inside the unit cell at specific fractional coordinates.\n   - There is 1 atom at position (1/3, 2/3, 1/8) and another at (2/3, 1/3, 5/8)\n   - These are fully contained within the unit cell\n   - Contribution from interior: 1 atom\n\nWait, let me reconsider this more carefully. In wurtzite structure:\n\nThe wurtzite structure has 4 formula units per unit cell. Since each formula unit of BN contains 1 boron atom and 1 nitrogen atom, there are 4 boron atoms and 4 nitrogen atoms in the unit cell.\n\nLet me verify this by considering the atomic positions in wurtzite:\n- Boron atoms are located at: (0,0,0), (1/3,2/3,1/2), and their equivalent positions\n- Due to the hexagonal symmetry and the specific wurtzite arrangement, there are exactly 4 boron atoms per unit cell\n\nTherefore, the number of B atoms in the unit cell of w-BN is:\n\n$\\boxed{4}$\"\"\"\n\nModel's final answer: 4\n\nCorrect answer: 2.0\n\nJudgement:\n",

Protonate NH₃: NH₃ + H⁺ → NH₄⁺\n2. This reduces [NH₃], which shifts the complex equilibrium\n3. When [Ag⁺] becomes high enough, AgCl precipitates\n\nStep 3: Find the condition for AgCl precipitation.\nFor precipitation to just begin:\n[Ag⁺][Cl⁻] = Ksp = 1.8 × 10⁻¹⁰\n\nSince HCl provides Cl⁻, if we add n mol HCl:\n[Cl⁻] = n mol/1.00 L = n M\n\nStep 4: Relate [Ag⁺] to the complex equilibrium.\nThe formation constant expression:\nKf = [Ag(NH₃)₂⁺]/([Ag⁺][NH₃]²) = 1.6 × 10⁷\n\nTherefore: [Ag⁺] = [Ag(NH₃)₂⁺]/(Kf[NH₃]²)\n\nStep 5: Account for NH₃ consumption by HCl.\nIf n mol HCl is added:\n- n mol NH₃ is converted to NH₄⁺\n- [NH₃] = (0.98 - n) M\n- [Ag(NH₃)₂⁺] ≈ 0.01 M (assuming minimal dissociation initially)\n\nStep 6: Apply the precipitation condition.\nAt the point of precipitation:\n[Ag⁺] = [Ag(NH₃)₂⁺]/(Kf[NH₃]²) = 0.01/(1.6 × 10⁷ × (0.98 - n)²)\n\nAnd: [Ag⁺][Cl⁻] = Ksp\n[0.01/(1.6 × 10⁷ × (0.98 - n)²)] × n = 1.8 × 10⁻¹⁰\n\nStep 7: Solve for n.\n0.01n/(1.6 × 10⁷ × (0.98 - n)²) = 1.8 × 10⁻¹⁰\n\n0.01n = 1.8 × 10⁻¹⁰ × 1.6 × 10⁷ × (0.98 - n)²\n0.01n = 2.88 × 10⁻³ × (0.98 - n)²\n\nSince n will be much smaller than 0.98, we can approximate (0.98 - n)² ≈ (0.98)² = 0.9604\n\n0.01n = 2.88 × 10⁻³ × 0.9604\n0.01n = 2.766 × 10⁻³\nn = 0.2766\n\nThis approximation isn't valid since n is not << 0.98. Let me solve exactly:\n\n0.01n = 2.88 × 10⁻³ × (0.98 - n)²\n\nLet me rearrange: 2.88 × 10⁻³ × (0.98 - n)² - 0.01n = 0\n\nExpanding: 2.88 × 10⁻³ × (0.9604 - 1.96n + n²) - 0.01n = 0\n2.766 × 10⁻³ - 5.645 × 10⁻³n + 2.88 × 10⁻³n² - 0.01n = 0\n2.88 × 10⁻³n² - 0.015645n + 2.766 × 10⁻³ = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\nn = [0.015645 ± √(0.015645² - 4(2.88 × 10⁻³)(2.766 × 10⁻³))]/(2 × 2.88 × 10⁻³)\nn = [0.015645 ± √(2.448 × 10⁻⁴ - 3.188 × 10⁻⁵)]/(5.76 × 10⁻³)\nn = [0.015645 ± √(2.129 × 10⁻⁴)]/(5.76 × 10⁻³)\nn = [0.015645 ± 0.01459]/(5.76 × 10⁻³)\n\nTaking the smaller root (physical solution):\nn = (0.015645 - 0.01459)/(5.76 × 10⁻³) = 0.001055/5.76 × 10⁻³ = 0.183\n\n\\boxed{0.183} mol\"\"\"\n\nModel's final answer: 0.183\n\nCorrect answer: 0.18\n\nJudgement:\n",

For the reaction CO + H₂O ⇌ CO₂ + H₂:\n\nKₚ = (P_CO₂ × P_H₂)/(P_CO × P_H₂O)\n\nSince Δn = 0 (same number of moles on both sides), Kₚ = Kc.\n\nStep 4: Express Kₚ in terms of mole fractions.\nKₚ = (x_CO₂ × x_H₂)/(x_CO × x_H₂O) = ((20+x)/120 × (20+x)/120)/((40-x)/120 × (40-x)/120)\n\nKₚ = (20+x)²/(40-x)²\n\nStep 5: Solve for x.\n0.64 = (20+x)²/(40-x)²\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n√0.64 = (20+x)/(40-x)\n0.8 = (20+x)/(40-x)\n\nStep 6: Solve the equation.\n0.8(40-x) = 20+x\n32 - 0.8x = 20 + x\n32 - 20 = x + 0.8x\n12 = 1.8x\nx = 12/1.8 = 6.67 mol\n\nStep 7: Calculate moles of CO₂ at equilibrium.\nn_CO₂ = 20 + x = 20 + 6.67 = 26.67 mol\n\nStep 8: Verify the solution.\nAt equilibrium:\n- CO: 40 - 6.67 = 33.33 mol\n- H₂O: 40 - 6.67 = 33.33 mol  \n- CO₂: 20 + 6.67 = 26.67 mol\n- H₂: 20 + 6.67 = 26.67 mol\n\nCheck: Kₚ = (26.67)²/(33.33)² = 711.3/1111.0 = 0.64 ✓\n\nTherefore, the number of moles of CO₂ leaving the reactor is:\n\n$\\boxed{26.7}$ mol\"\"\"\n\nModel's final answer: 26.7\n\nCorrect answer: 26.7\n\nJudgement:\n",
