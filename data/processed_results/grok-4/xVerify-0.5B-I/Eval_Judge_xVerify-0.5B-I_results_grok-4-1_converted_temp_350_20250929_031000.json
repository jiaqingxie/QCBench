The minimum concentration of chloride ions needed in oyster beds for normal growth is $8 \\mathrm{ppm}\\left(8 \\mathrm{mg} \\mathrm{dm}^{-3}\\right)$.\n\nAfter one week of heavy rain, the following analysis is done on water from the bay. To a $50.00 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ sample of bay water a few drops of a $\\mathrm{K}_{2} \\mathrm{CrO}_{4}$ solution are added. The sample is then titrated with $16.16 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of a $0.00164 \\mathrm{M} \\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ solution. After $\\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ solution has been added to the sample a bright red-orange precipitate forms.\n\nThe chloride concentration in another $50.00 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ sample of bay water was determined by the Volhard method. In this method an excess of $\\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ is added to the sample. The excess $\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$is titrated with standardized $\\mathrm{KSCN}$, forming a precipitate of $\\mathrm{AgSCN}$. The endpoint is signalled by the formation of the reddish-brown $\\mathrm{FeSCN}^{2+}$ complex that forms when $\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$is depleted. If the excess $\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$from the addition of $50.00 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of $0.00129 \\mathrm{M} \\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ to the water sample required $27.46 \\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of $1.4110^{-3}$ M KSCN for titration, calculate the concentration of chloride in the bay water sample.\n\nIn natural waters with much higher concentration of $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, the $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$can be determined gravimetrically by precipitating the $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$as $\\mathrm{AgCl}$. A complicating feature of this method is the fact that $\\mathrm{AgCl}$ is susceptible to photodecomposition as shown by the reaction:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{AgCl}(\\mathrm{s}) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Ag}(\\mathrm{s})+1 / 2 \\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\\mathrm{~g})\n$$\n\nFurthermore, if this photodecomposition occurs in the presence of excess $\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$, the following additional reaction occurs:\n\n$3 \\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\\mathrm{~g})+3 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}+5 \\mathrm{Ag}^{+} \\rightarrow 5 \\mathrm{AgCl}+\\mathrm{ClO}_{3}{ }^{-}+6 \\mathrm{H}^{+}$\n\nIf $0.010 \\mathrm{~g}$ of a $3.000 \\mathrm{~g}$ sample of $\\mathrm{AgCl}$ contaminated with excess $\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$undergoes photodecomposition by the above equations\"\"\"\n\nModel's reasoning: \"\"\"\\boxed{5.15 \\times 10^{-4}} mol dm^{-3}\"\"\"\n\nModel's final answer: 5.150000E-04\n\nCorrect answer: 5.160000E-04\n\nJudgement:\n",
