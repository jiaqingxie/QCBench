Calculate the total change in entropy, when a sample of nitrogen gas of mass $14 \\mathrm{~g}$ at $298 \\mathrm{~K}$ and $1.00 \\mathrm{bar}$ doubles its volume in an adiabatic reversible expansion.\"\"\"\n\nModel's reasoning: \"\"\"### Step-by-Step Solution\n\nThe process is an adiabatic reversible expansion of an ideal gas (nitrogen, treated as perfect). For such a process, the entropy change of the system is zero because it is isentropic.\n\nTo confirm using the entropy change formula for an ideal gas:\n\nThe number of moles is \\( n = \\frac{14 \\, \\mathrm{g}}{28 \\, \\mathrm{g/mol}} = 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{mol} \\).\n\nFor diatomic nitrogen, \\( C_V = \\frac{5}{2} R \\), \\( C_P = \\frac{7}{2} R \\), \\( \\gamma = \\frac{C_P}{C_V} = 1.4 \\).\n\nThe entropy change is given by:\n\\[\n\\Delta S = n C_V \\ln \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right) + n R \\ln \\left( \\frac{V_2}{V_1} \\right),\n\\]\nwhere \\( V_2 = 2 V_1 \\).\n\nFor reversible adiabatic expansion, \\( T_2 = T_1 \\left( \\frac{V_1}{V_2} \\right)^{\\gamma - 1} \\), so:\n\\[\n\\ln \\left( \\frac{T_2}{T_1} \\right) = (\\gamma - 1) \\ln \\left( \\frac{V_1}{V_2} \\right) = -(\\gamma - 1) \\ln \\left( \\frac{V_2}{V_1} \\right).\n\\]\n\nSubstitute:\n\\[\n\\Delta S = n C_V \\left[ -(\\gamma - 1) \\ln \\left( \\frac{V_2}{V_1} \\right) \\right] + n R \\ln \\left( \\frac{V_2}{V_1} \\right) = -n C_V (\\gamma - 1) \\ln \\left( \\frac{V_2}{V_1} \\right) + n R \\ln \\left( \\frac{V_2}{V_1} \\right).\n\\]\n\nSince \\( \\gamma - 1 = \\frac{R}{C_V} \\), it follows that \\( C_V (\\gamma - 1) = R \\), so:\n\\[\n\\Delta S = -n R \\ln \\left( \\frac{V_2}{V_1} \\right) + n R \\ln \\left( \\frac{V_2}{V_1} \\right) = 0.\n\\]\n\nThe process is adiabatic, so \\( \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{surroundings}} = 0 \\). Thus, the total entropy change (\\( \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{system}} + \\Delta S_{\\mathrm{surroundings}} \\)) is 0.\n\n\\boxed{0}\"\"\"\n\nModel's final answer: 0\n\nCorrect answer: 0\n\nJudgement:\n",

The most efficient way of using hydrogen is generation of electrical energy in a fuel cell. However, storing hydrogen in large quantities is a challenge in fuel cell applications. Among the chemical hydrides considered as solid hydrogen storage materials, sodium borohydride $\\left(\\mathrm{NaBH}_{4}\\right)$, being non-toxic, stable and environmentally benign, appears to be the most promising one. The hydrolysis of sodium borohydride that releases $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ gas is a slow reaction at ambient temperature and, therefore, needs to be catalyzed.\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{NaBH}_{4}(\\mathrm{aq})+2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}(I)  \\xrightarrow{catalyst} \\mathrm{Na}^{+}(\\mathrm{aq})+\\mathrm{BO}_{2}^{-}(\\mathrm{aq})+4 \\mathrm{H}_{2}(g)\n$$\n\nColloidal ruthenium(0) nanoclusters are the most active catalysts in this hydrolysis even at room temperature and lead to a complete $\\mathrm{H}_{2}$ release from sodium borohydride. Kinetic studies show that the catalytic hydrolysis of $\\mathrm{NaBH}_{4}$ is a first order reaction with respect to the catalyst, but a zero order with respect to the substrate. The rate of hydrogen production per mole of ruthenium is $92 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\cdot(\\mathrm{mol} \\mathrm{Ru})^{-1} \\cdot \\min ^{-1}$ at $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$.Calculate the amount of ruthenium catalyst (in $\\mathrm{mg}$ ) which must be added to $0.100 \\mathrm{dm}^{3}$ of $\\mathrm{NaBH}_{4}$ solution with a concentration of $1.0 \\mathrm{~mol} \\mathrm{dm}^{-3}$ to supply the hydrogen gas at a rate of $0.100 \\mathrm{dm}^{3} \\cdot \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ at $25^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and $1.0 \\mathrm{~atm}$, that is required for a portable fuel cell.\"\"\"\n\nModel's reasoning: \"\"\"\\boxed{4.5} mg\"\"\"\n\nModel's final answer: 4.5\n\nCorrect answer: 4.5\n\nJudgement:\n",

Each F ligand has a charge of -1, so 6 F contribute -6. The overall charge is -3, so the oxidation state of Cu is +3.\n\n2. **Electron configuration of Cu**:  \n   Atomic number of Cu is 29, so neutral Cu has configuration \\([Ar] 3d^{10} 4s^1\\).  \n   For Cu^{3+}, 3 electrons are removed: the 4s^1 electron and 2 from 3d^{10}, resulting in 3d^8.\n\n3. **Geometry and crystal field splitting**:  \n   The complex has 6 ligands, so it is octahedral. For d^8 in an octahedral field, the configuration is \\(t_{2g}^6 e_g^2\\).\n\n4. **Number of unpaired electrons**:  \n   In \\(t_{2g}^6 e_g^2\\), the t_{2g} electrons are all paired (6 electrons in 3 orbitals), and the e_g set has 2 electrons in 2 orbitals, which are unpaired. Thus, n = 2 unpaired electrons.  \n   (Note: For d^8 octahedral, there is no high-spin/low-spin distinction that changes this; it is always 2 unpaired.)\n\n5. **Spin-only magnetic moment**:  \n   The formula is \\(\\mu = \\sqrt{n(n+2)}\\) BM.  \n   Substitute n = 2: \\(\\mu = \\sqrt{2(2+2)} = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}\\) BM.\n\n\\boxed{2\\sqrt{2}} BM\"\"\"\n\nModel's final answer: 21.414214\n\nCorrect answer: 2.84\n\nJudgement:\n",
