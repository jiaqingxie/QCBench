What is the minimum amount of HCl that would need to be added to this solution to induce precipitation of AgCl? The Ksp of AgCl is 1.8 ¡ä 10-10; the Kf of Ag(NH3)2 + is 1.6 ¡ä 107 ; and the Ka of NH4 + is 5.6 ¡ä 10-10.\"\"\"\n\nModel's reasoning: \"\"\"Step 1.  Mass balances  \nSilver: CAg = [Ag⁺] + [Ag(NH₃)₂⁺] = 0.010 M  \n\nAmmonia (total 1.00 M) after adding x mol L⁻¹ of HCl:  \n1.00 = [NH₃] + [NH₄⁺] + 2[Ag(NH₃)₂⁺]  \nStoichiometrically HCl converts NH₃ → NH₄⁺, so [NH₄⁺] ≈ x and  \n[NH₃] = 1.00 – x – 2[Ag(NH₃)₂⁺].\n\nWith [Ag(NH₃)₂⁺] ≈ 0.010 M (because free Ag⁺ is kept very small, see below), this simplifies to  \n[NH₃] ≈ 0.98 – x.                                       (1)\n\nStep 2.  Equilibrium relations  \nFormation of the ammine complex: β₂ = 1.6 × 10⁷  \nβ₂ = [Ag(NH₃)₂⁺] / ( [Ag⁺][NH₃]² ).                     (2)\n\nPrecipitation threshold for AgCl: Ksp = 1.8 × 10⁻¹⁰  \nAt the instant precipitation begins  \nKsp = [Ag⁺][Cl⁻] with [Cl⁻] = x (from the added HCl), so  \n[Ag⁺] = Ksp / x = 1.8 × 10⁻¹⁰ / x.                       (3)\n\nStep 3.  Insert the approximations  \nBecause [Ag⁺] ≪ 0.010 M, set [Ag(NH₃)₂⁺] ≈ 0.010 M in (2) and use (1) and (3):\n\n1.6 × 10⁷ = 0.010 / { (1.8 × 10⁻¹⁰ / x)(0.98 – x)² }\n\nSolve for x:\n\n0.01 x = 2.88 × 10⁻³ (0.98 – x)²  \nx = 0.288 (0.98 – x)²  \n→ x ≈ 0.183 mol L⁻¹.\n\nStep 4.  Consistency check  \n[NH₃] = 0.98 – 0.183 ≈ 0.80 M  \n[Ag⁺] = 1.8 × 10⁻¹⁰ / 0.183 ≈ 9.8 × 10⁻¹⁰ M  \nβ₂ computed with these values gives 1.6 × 10⁷, confirming internal consistency, and the buffer pH (from Ka = 5.6×10⁻¹⁰) is ≈9.9, so the stoichiometric treatment of HCl is valid.\n\nTherefore, the minimum amount of HCl required per litre is\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.8\\times10^{-1}}\n\\] mol\"\"\"\n\nModel's final answer: 0.18\n\nCorrect answer: 0.18\n\nJudgement:\n",
