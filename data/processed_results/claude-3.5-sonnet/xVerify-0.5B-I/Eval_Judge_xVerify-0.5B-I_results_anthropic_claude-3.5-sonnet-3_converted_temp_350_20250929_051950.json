During the reaction, temperature increases from $298.0 \\mathrm{~K}$ to $312.8 \\mathrm{~K}$. If heat capacity of the bomb calorimeter and enthalpy of formation of $\\mathrm{Hg}(g)$ are $20.00 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~K}^{-1}$ and $61.32 \\mathrm{~kJ}$ $\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ at $298 \\mathrm{~K}$, respectively, the calculated standard molar enthalpy of formation of $\\mathrm{HgO}(s)$ at 298 $\\mathrm{K}$ is $\\mathrm{X} \\mathrm{kJ} \\mathrm{mol} \\mathrm{m}^{-1}$.
