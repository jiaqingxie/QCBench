Taking the \\ce{CO2} produced from burning \\pu{1 L} of E5 fuel as \\pu{100 %}, what is the percentage of \\ce{CO2} produced from burning \\pu{1 L} of E10 fuel. Consider only \\ce{CO2} formed from the combustion of octane isomers?\"\"\"\n\nModel's reasoning: \"\"\"Let me solve this step by step.\n\n1) First, let's understand what we're comparing:\n   * We need to compare CO₂ from octane combustion only\n   * E10: 900 mL octane\n   * E5: 950 mL octane\n   * E5 is taken as 100%\n\n2) Since we're only looking at CO₂ from octane, and the volume of octane directly correlates to CO₂ produced:\n   * If 950 mL octane (E5) → 100% CO₂\n   * Then 900 mL octane (E10) → x%\n\n3) We can set up a proportion:\n   * 950 mL : 100% = 900 mL : x%\n\n4) Solve for x:\n   * x = (900 × 100) ÷ 950\n   * x = 90000 ÷ 950\n   * x = 94.74%\n\nTherefore, burning 1 L of E10 fuel produces 94.74% of the CO₂ from octane combustion compared to 1 L of E5 fuel.\n\n\\boxed{94.74} %\"\"\"\n\nModel's final answer: 94.74\n\nCorrect answer: 94.7\n\nJudgement:\n",
