The laminar flame speed at \\pu{25 deg C}, \\pu{101.325 kPa} and air to fuel equivalence ratio ($\\lambda$) of 1.2 is \\pu{0.38 m/s}. What would be the air flow rate (\\pu{L/min}) if reactants enter the burner at \\pu{25 deg C}, \\pu{101.325 kPa} and air to fuel equivalence ratio ($\\lambda$) of 1.2?\"\"\"\n\nModel's reasoning: \"\"\"The flame is stationary relative to the burner, so the gas velocity at the burner exit equals the laminar flame speed.  \n\\[\nv = 0.38\\;\\text{m s}^{-1}\n\\]\n\nThe cross‑sectional area of the tube is  \n\\[\nA = \\pi\\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2\n   = \\pi\\left(\\frac{8\\times10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}}{2}\\right)^2\n   = 5.03\\times10^{-5}\\;\\text{m}^2 .\n\\]\n\nHence the volumetric flow rate of the reactants is  \n\\[\nQ_{\\text{tot}} = A\\,v\n               = 5.03\\times10^{-5}\\;\\text{m}^2 \\times 0.38\\;\\text{m s}^{-1}\n               = 1.91\\times10^{-5}\\;\\text{m}^3\\text{s}^{-1}\n               = 0.0191\\;\\text{L s}^{-1}\n               = 1.15\\;\\text{L min}^{-1}.\n\\]\n\nFor methane the stoichiometric air per mole of fuel is  \n\\[\nn_{\\text{air,stoich}} = \\frac{2}{0.21}=9.52\\;\\text{mol air mol}^{-1}\\text{fuel}.\n\\]\n\nWith an equivalence ratio \\(\\lambda =1.2\\),\n\\[\nn_{\\text{air}} = \\lambda\\,n_{\\text{air,stoich}} = 1.2\\times9.52=11.43\\;\\text{mol air mol}^{-1}\\text{fuel}.\n\\]\n\nThus the fraction of air in the total flow is  \n\\[\n\\frac{n_{\\text{air}}}{n_{\\text{air}}+n_{\\text{fuel}}}\n= \\frac{11.43}{11.43+1}=0.919 .\n\\]\n\nFinally, the air flow rate is  \n\\[\nQ_{\\text{air}} = 0.919\\,Q_{\\text{tot}}\n               = 0.919\\times1.15\\;\\text{L min}^{-1}\n               \\approx 1.05\\;\\text{L min}^{-1}.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1.05}\\,\\text{L min}^{-1}\n\\]\"\"\"\n\nModel's final answer: 1.05\n\nCorrect answer: 1.24\n\nJudgement:\n",
